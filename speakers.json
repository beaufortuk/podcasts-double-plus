        "text_corpus": " The Economist The leaders here assemble can rewrite human history in the new millennium. If we have learned the lessons of the past, we can leave a very different legacy for our children. As a result, the number of people that live on less than $1.25 per day has dropped by more than half. The number of primary school-age kids who don't go to school, down by almost half, child mortality, down by almost half. May I take it that the assembly wishes to adopt draft resolution a slash 70 slash L1. It is so decided. An interday show has international development stopped working. All of these are worthy causes, but if the pie of aid is not increasing, and then the proportion of aid that can go on long-term developments has also significantly shrunk. The thinking has changed quite a lot. One thing I recognize much more important now is who has the agency? If you go back to the first year of COVID, what nearly every country on the planet did and what was recommended by the INF and the World Bank and others was to maximize counter-sicklical spending. So in high income countries, that involved massive increases in debt, but that debt could be borrowed domestically because there be liquid domestic debt markets. In low income countries which have fewer resources already, which got stretched very quickly, they were forced to resort to borrowing on international markets. But suddenly when the interest rate cycle shifted in the United States, the debt service payments for these countries became extraordinarily high. They exceeded cumulatively payments going on health and education and infrastructure in well over 60 countries. And that just fiscal challenge becomes a massive constraint in terms of pulling back the government's ability to invest in basic services for what we describe as human development. While the debt service issue became a precipitating crisis, it was exacerbated by two other trends. One is many of these countries depend a lot on international aid, especially in key sectors like health. And those also dropped in the post-COVID era, in aggregate some of the demands going on Ukraine, the issue of migrants, which is covered by aid spending, new humanitarian crises, that met to another source of funding that got steadily diminished. Support for migration actually is an ideal legitimate use of aid spending. But when it comes from the same cool of financing that was going to be used to invest in primary health care or primary education in Africa, and it's now supporting housing for migrants across Europe, then that is a significant displacement. Similarly with Ukraine, Ukraine aid has multiple categories, there's military a bit of the non-military aid. All of these are worthy causes, but if the pie of aid is not increasing, and then the proportion of aid that can go on long-term development has also significantly shrunk. And then the third leg of the stool was, as these economies contracted, their ability to raise resources domestically, also shrank, and they had much smaller pools of financing available. So the triple combination, much larger debt payments, decline in aid, and a contraction of the domestic capacity to spend, has ended up being a huge shock to the system, and the consequences are exactly the indicators we're seeing now. One of the few pools of money that got significantly larger during the last five years of the COVID period was private wealth. The number of global billionaires has increased significantly, and the wealth in the hands of existing billionaires has also increased significantly. And the main argument we make is that this is a critical investment for anthropic resources can play a catalytic role not in substituting for, and this is critical. We should not be a substitute for basic government expenditure, or, and we shouldn't be displacing the private sector when private capital is going to be our most useful and general to return. But what we can do is do the risk taking. We can test interventions, different health interventions, different education interventions, we're working right now extensively in areas like AI. And that's just a very high return area for philanthropic capital. Those are sectors that you wouldn't get private capital, and government can pay then for the scaling of successful models. I worry at one level even governments have started to look to philanthropy or private capital is kind of miracle money that can come in and offset some of the basic public investments. And the phrase public private partnership is part of nearly any international gathering you can go to from Davos to the United Nations General Assembly. And we fully believe that there is huge benefits to such partners, but you've got to get very concrete about what you mean. So a great example of what we think is arguably the most successful public private partnership of the last 25 years is the Gavi vaccine alliance. That's an initiative that we help set up in the early 2000s with several governments, including the United Kingdom, the United States and many others. And what that did was it said one of the big challenges is many countries can't afford to vaccinate their children. And so if we pull money, we can incentivize the private sector to produce high quality low cost vaccines, which can then be purchased at bulk and then distributed across eligible countries, 70 eligible countries. And that has led to a massive improvement in vaccination rates and health outcomes. And so when they're balanced together, they balance together very well. But far too often, and I think the climate space is one of those where we haven't quite managed the right division of labor and responsibilities and what you do have is some diversion of capital. Your view is that the most concessional capital, grant capital or private philanthropy should be used for the sectors that are long term human investments, but don't have a short term return. So that is basic health care and basic education. In many climate mitigation investments, which are essentially renewable energy and other tools, those legitimately have returned there. You can use loans, soft the loans, guaranteed loans from the World Bank and others. And then some should be purely private sector investments. And in fact, we've been doing some work at the Gates Foundation trying to have a clear degradation about which kinds of capital are best used for which types of investments in the climate space in particular. In the key sectors that we focus most on, and again, I'll come back to health because I do think it's easy to just look only at GDP per capita as your primary outcome. And that is a critical outcome, but there is a kind of chicken and egg, you know, that if you don't have these significant investments in health and education, including in basic nutrition, because in the first two years of life, if a child does not get out of good nutrition, their brain and body will never fully develop. And that's the human capital that will never become a fully productive member of a thriving economy or society. And so you need those bedrock investments, and there I am relatively optimistic. I do think the lessons we've learned about interventions in anti-natal care, postnatal care, in nutrition could be transformative over a generation. In terms of the broader economic opportunities, there I'm more mixed. If there isn't some kind of thoughtful resumption of access to capital for many of these low and middle income countries, including access to aid in some of these key critical sectors that need concessional financing, then I am nervous. So we say I won't say all the way pessimistic, but I think it's going to be very challenging if there aren't a combination of these other sources of capital that can help generate economic growth, supplementing the core investments in health and education that are the fundamental building blocks for long term development. It's been a confusing, confused time, which a lot of people were slow to spot because the poorest countries had a golden decade from about 2003 to about 2014. And the reason was that their economies were so unsuccessful that the one activity that they got was exporting their natural resources from 2003 through to 2014. You got a boom in the prices of natural resources. And so the poorest countries disproportionately benefited from that. And that gave the illusion that they were growing. But since 2014, when there was a crash in commodity prices, the back to the old normal. And so there was this deceptive good decade. And other than that, we're back to the process of divergence. First of all, the Lewis economic analysis was right as far as it went. I'm not trying in any way to deny economic processes, the massive move towards urbanization, which is potentially a very good thing because as people move into cities, there's better connectivity, better scale, better specialization. So I'm not denying these economic forces, but they are overlaid with political forces and social forces. One is quite weak governance, often rather predatory leadership that is trying to enrich a particular group through patronage rather than develop the whole country. It's not always like that. You can have good leaders. There's also social forces that they are groundwork of ideas. So what you want to do, what you ought to do, and who you are. These are ideas which a good leader can gradually influence or a bad leader can influence. And they can be very powerful. One of the things that needs transferring from the rich countries to poor countries is indeed agency. The power to take control of your own lives is the only thing that's compatible with dignity, a sense of self worth that we have the agency to shape our lives. Then there are things I call cognitive gadgets, which are little techniques, which can be difficult to work out. But once you see in them somewhere, you can just learn it straight away. An example I give in the book is the use of sites and services in urbanization. Urbanization is a very important process in poor countries, but we look at a lot of cities that are big in poor countries. They're big but bad. So how do you avoid mega slums when you start with very little money? So sites and services are saying the best way to urbanize in a poor country is for the local government of the city to set out a future road network, which you can do by very simple things like planting a line of trees to indicate here there's going to be a road. Underneath the road puts the water, the electricity, the sewage that's needed, then create marketable plots of land within that grid, which you can sell to people and then leave it to them to invest in building their own homes gradually on those plots that they buy. Very often local governments in poor countries attempt to try to tackle the housing shortage directly by building public housing. That's hugely expensive and completely unviable given the scale of urban pace of urbanization. The thinking has changed quite a lot. One thing I recognize much more important now is who has the agency. So we're back to the idea that this is something that has to be done by poor places rather than two poor places. Now it can be done with the help of rich countries, but the lead and the design has to be in the poor country or the poor place. The local level of knowledge is often much superior to the knowledge acquired with a distance. And so that's a found move on from the bottom billion that recognition of the importance of devolution devolved decision taking. I think quite a lot of my thinking has changed after all I was the first external director of the research department of the world, brought in by Joe Stiglitz. I lot of respect for the staff of the world bank. There's certainly very expert as well as the staff of the IMF. But there are two weaknesses one is they tend to have to follow a party line. If you like an economic ideology and that produces something too close to a one size fits all. Whereas one of the great advantages of devolution of decision taking is to recognize that each place is somewhat different. And so the opportunities in one place might be rather different from the opportunities in another to be fair to it. The World Bank has somewhat decentralized its staff in one sense to the IMF got a more difficult journey still than the World Bank. I think both have this problem that they are overconfident in their belief that their expertise gives them a basis for knowing how they should help developing countries. And so they tend to enforce that with conditions. You can have our money, but only if you take our advice. I think that's a very poor model. A much better model is to separate advice from money. Thank you indeed. No comment. No comment. This is the problem. All of the best stats back there in the business section. Yeah, yeah. Convenient. Convenient view. And the executive producer is Hannah Marigno. I'm Mike Bird. I'm Alice Foward. I'm Tom Lee Devlin. And this is the economist. Thank you. When you think about Pennsylvania, you all think about it as multiple regions with very separate political identities. The southeast part of the state is the Philadelphia metropolitan area, one of the largest in the country. It has very prosperous, highly educated suburbs. And that part of the state has a large share of the electorate and one that has increasingly become Democratic over the last few election cycles and are now in many ways the engine of democratic success in the state. You move out of the southeast corner of the state into the north and the western parts of the state and it quickly becomes very rural. Pennsylvania also has one of the largest rural populations in the United States and those rural areas are deeply conservative. There are some pockets of cities out in Pittsburgh out west, Harrisburg, Scranton, Eury that are still fairly democratic. But outside of southeast Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania is a different political entity. It's often seen as more Midwestern in its identity while the southeast is truly Atlantic metropolitan in its nature. for the state? So Harris becoming the nominee for the Democratic Party has transformed the race in Pennsylvania to a modest but important degree. If you looked at the race in late June and early July when President Biden was still likely nominee, the race was slipping away from the Democrats. Not too enormous point but about three or four points on average in the polls, which is in a place like Pennsylvania pretty significant. Since Vice President Harris became the nominee, the race has closed in Pennsylvania. Most polls now show it as a debt he, if you look at the averages, which largely aligns with what happened here in 2020 when Biden won by point, Trump won by half a point four years earlier. It's a state that's won unlost on the margins and we seem to be in that same place again. What Harris has done to help solidify her position in the polls and make it as tight as we've seen is really improve upon Biden's numbers and key constituencies within the Democratic Coalition, younger voters, progressive voters. She's helped build the advantage among women to levels that mirror more what the 2020 numbers were than where Biden was in early summer. relevant? I think it is this smart strategy. As I said, Pennsylvania is so tight in terms of the election. Little gains across counties that you lose and sometimes lose significantly, but modestly, improve upon can be quite impactful when we get to the final number. Both parties are taking on this approach. I'll give you some tangible examples. Talking with the local radio station in Lehigh Valley, that's a conservative talk radio station. The news director told me, Harris is running a lot of ads on our station. We're 95%, Republican 95% Trump. Why would you spend money on ads on a Democrat on a station like that? You're looking at the margin that 5% may be having some improvement there. Donald Trump in Philadelphia putting ads on Black radio stations that are overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning. That's the type of campaign that we're seeing. You look under every stone. You try to find voters on the margin that can add up and erase that everybody campaign structures and activities now. In Pennsylvania, you see a lot of activity on the ground and door knockers are everywhere. You walk out on the street on a weekend. You'll see people going back and forth where I live trying to get out the boat and encourage that. The strategy seems different, though. The party's strategies, Democrats, I think, are much more engaged in this outreach activity in the state, mobilizing voters, making contact with voters. It's not that Republicans aren't doing that at all, but to a far lesser degree, and especially with the Trump campaign, which seems to have taken. They say they have offices in the state. They say they're active in this, but there's not as much empirical proof of that. I think they're ultimately resting on their candidates appeal. It's a little bit of a test of those approaches and those strategies that's playing out here. You notice that you see it in the activity that's going on. ads are certainly spending a lot of money. The former president is in the state that seems on a daily basis, several few days. He's back here, but the structural aspects, the kind of organizational things that you would associate with a really major campaign and a major state don't seem to be as present as one might envision. I think it's a strategic choice. I don't know if it emanates from the top, but it seems pretty visible to me as someone that's observing This race is going to be close. They're going to put an out of money up there. They'll pay with boys believing his girls is sports. They don't care that a boy feels like he's a girl today. He can walk into a girl's bathroom. That is not who we are here. and I'm not going to cut social security. I wasn't handed anything. I was born here, I was raised here, I reinvested here, I created jobs here. I'm running against a guy who votes a Joe Biden nearly 100% at a time, AOC 95% of the time. You can't say that you represented more of Eastern Pennsylvania with a booby record like this. Two days ago, he voted against the gas power vehicles. He wants to tell us that we have to try electric vehicles. Listen, if you want to let your vehicle, I'm all for it. Drive it. But I don't want to be told that that's what I have to do. Finally, we have a business person that's going to run a country like a business. And both sides hate him the elitist from the Republican Party and the Democrat Party. Everybody would power. Everybody that has millions hated him, kind of like Jesus. Not a funny, isn't it? Kind of like everybody else, like Mindela, like Rose Supparks, like every other person that wants views they do. That's how I got involved with politics is that I realize that people don't have a voice and the people in government, whether it's Democrat or Republican, they really don't, they pass over the common person and they hurt people. And I am fighting for them. That's what got me I believe we're going to have a fascist state. Like Hillary said, she wants to put us in jail. She said that. There's a big move in the Democrat party to take our first amendment right. And then if they own everything, if they win, they have the CIA, the FBI, they have everything, they have said that they want to put us in camps. Videos have showed it. And I'm afraid. So because I want to have a free country, I want to tell people that this vote matters and So Bellevue is a pretty working class neighborhood right outside of Main Area Pittsburgh. Literally one bridge outside of the city technically. But it's definitely a place that has seen the kind of an increase in people wanting to live here. It seems like a lot of the people here are voting for Harris or say that they will. And I guess your job is to make sure that they actually turn on the vote. Yeah, you can't take your granted that people are going to be able to get out on a lachenday right or they're going to be able to get out work if they're going to be able to make it. We're going to drop the kids off their school. So checking in with folks, giving them that noise is not reminder to make a plan can be really helpful. And what's your sense of why people here are voting for Harris? Okay, the question. I think she is representative of them. I think coming from a middle class family being able to go to law school, right? I think that's a American dream, right? For parents or immigrants can work hard and get an opportunity. But I don't think you've looked given up on that dream and I think you can see themselves in her and that. I also think there's simple math, right? Her plans make sense. I think when they see somebody at Karmala, they see somebody who means what they say. But I think specifically here people, I think it goes back to opportunity. People want to, I don't think anybody wants their children to have less opportunity than what they me what he was hearing from voters. Costs are on folks minds. I think they're mad about corporate price gouging and the way that some of these executives brag about it. People want our democracy to be functional and normal and healthy and not something they have to worry about. And one wants to think about a candidate like Donald Trump trying to overthrow the Constitution and doing what he did on January 6th. They don't want to have abortion rights ripped away. Most people, the overwhelming majority of my constituents, don't think this is something the government ought to be interfering in. And I think people just want to have secure, prosperous, normal lives without wacky extreme stuff like you hear out of Trump and a lot of the right wing Republicans these days. I think they just want a normal, healthy, strong democracy. voters, right? How do you kind of fight against that current, if you will, that affects district voters. And what do you deal with it? Democrats like me have been doing better with the exact kind of voters you're asking about than say 2016. And I think that is a result and a reflection of a commitment to standing up for workers for labor rights. It mattered in 2020 that Joe Biden campaigned the way he did and what he said about standing up for workers' rights. And now, has been the most pro-union president of my lifetime. I represent a region that very proudly made and still makes steel, built this country. And we suffered through terrible trade deals that really hurt places like Western Pennsylvania pushed by Wall Street and corporate management ideology that just chased the cheapest and weakest labor and environmental rules. That kind of policy decision making I think was misguided was a mistake. And what we've seen Democrats like me who recognize that who understand fundamentally we have to do something different. predictive of the rest of the state. It's wider, it's less educated and economically more downscaled than the average Pennsylvania. At the same time, 20% of people in the city of Eri are either African American or recent immigrants. The city of Eri is a democratic stronghold and then you throw on the suburbs, right? I mean, these are these college-educated Republicans who don't vote for Trump. Throw on to that, there's a lot of rural whites who are conservative. And so it's kind of this perfect bell weather, right? And it's a demographic microcosm of the state. If a Democrat can do well here, then they can do well enough for the rest of the state. And what are you seeing the Harris's folks out here doing things? Or what do you see? Yeah. So another piece of this is just the Eri County Democratic Party itself. And that what it hasn't done is follow the national trend of being hijacked. I would argue, you know, buying for the professional middle class. I mean, not just what the national party is. I mean, looking back like the Harris Shapiro ticket would have been the perfect distillation of what the modern Democratic Party has become, coastal warriors. So the Eri County Democratic Party, what they do is they have a bunch of normy Democrats and they're going door to door. And they're able to fight off the national brand, you know, like, okay, well, Kamala Harris might believe X, but you know, that's not Kyle Faust, he's the county com throller. So Harris is here, right? I mean, they have eight state staffers in the Eri County Democratic Party itself, you know, like they're investing. They're a boots on the ground. When you talk to folks here, maybe your classes are just out about what are the kinds of things that express most interest to issue wise that the economy inflation basically above all? There are people who might have been open to voting for a Democrat, you know, and they're like, look, things were better under Trump. And again, because lower middle class or working class, it's, you know, your dollar does not go as far. So I think inflation for a certain kind of eerieite, right? Because this is a very cost conscious market, right? This is not a wealthy place, you know, as compared to Perkinsville, Adolfia. So inflation really matters, especially for a kind of white ethnic Democrat, who was like, maybe they voted Trump in 16 and maybe they're like, I like Joe Biden in 20. I could see that mattering. But, you know, what I've heard again and again, I mean, it really isn't about the issues. It's really about Donald Trump. Does he repel you? Where does he attract you? The Economist The Economist I like to be in nature because I find it very calming and relaxing and in London sometimes that's quite hard to find. I feel it's such an uncommon relaxing. We are part of the natural environment, we're living breathing beings and so I feel like it's just a obvious that we will be more related to it and we'd feel better amongst it. It's not artificial, so I think there's something about being in a place that isn't artificial, which is quite primal, which feels like it's a way from modern life. So when you walk around Q, you're getting these incredible sense of all the sort of things like rosemary and lavender and thyme. If you walk until like the temperate house, you get this very moist mossy smell in there. You've got these great fronds, green fronds and all the tree palms hanging down over you and in the background they've got a water-fetched in here water as well. So you've got this incredible smell, these very green colours and then on top of that you have these incredibly huge flowers where they're the size of two hands put together. And they're bright pink and red and white. Then if you wander into the arboretum, then you've got all these different sorts of trunks with all this very nubbly and gnarly bark on them and some a very smooth bark. And so that's again a completely different sensual experience of walking amongst the trees in the arboretum. You know people think, oh, Botanic Garden is boring, they cannot be more wrong. When I walked around gardens in my lunchtime break, I often felt much better. But I didn't realise that actually there was a mechanism of action that was happening in my body that really was changing me physiologically and psychologically. When we walk through nature, we have physiological and psychological calming. And so for example, your blood pressure goes down, your heart rate goes down, your brain wave activity becomes enhanced there as it indicates you're more relaxed. Your adrenaline hormones go down. So all of the things that we would normally associate with being stressed activities and stressed parts of your body, everything calms down. And psychologically we also calm down. People are much happier and for much more relaxed when they walk in nature. So this is the work I've been doing over the last five years. I've written a book called Good Nature. And that was triggered by a study I kept coming across that showed that people who were in hospital beds who looked out onto green recovered faster. And they took less drugs for pain relief than those who looked out onto brick wall. Now to me, the really interesting thing about the study was well, they're lying in a hospital bed. It's not the effect of let's say green cleaning the air and then make some breath easier, etc. There's something to directly relate to them seeing green and actually recovering faster. And that paper was published in science. So one of our top scientific journals. So I was looking for is there evidence now to show that there's a mechanism of action that occurs when we interact with nature? And that was the work I've been doing over the last five years. And I've been absolutely amazed how much information there is published in medical journals, published in environmental journals, published in psychiatry journals. And then they've measured their physiological parameters and shown very clearly that there is a direct mechanism of action that occurs in our bodies when we interact with nature. And if I might add to that the problem with nature is people tend to put it into the sort of fluffy bunny sort of bucket where it's a nice as an add-on, but it can't be used instead of. And I think what we're coming to understand is that nature itself, certain types of nature and how we interact with it can be as effective if not more effective than taking a prescription drug. And so that has huge policy and also economic implications going forwards. I mean, it's both physiological and psychological most of the time when you're looking at these interactions, but people who look for example at brainwave activity they'll be looking at stress hormones. There's a standard questionnaire that psychiatrists use to look at people's anxiety levels, for example. These are clinical trials which have been blind tested to show the actual reductions that occur when we interact with particular sorts of nature. It's not all nature, for example. It's all kinds of nature. So it'll be things like if you are in a park then you should go near areas, got more trees in them, a certain number of trees anyway. And also have higher levels of biodiversity, more mixtures of planting in there. A flat football pitch has a very different effect and doesn't really tick the boxes in terms of physiological, psychological calming as it would have you walk through a more wooded area or an area with a very rich, very rich. So all of those things and each of those can have a slightly different effect on you. But I think one of the really interesting ones is the ones to do a smell because most of these other things are triggering a system in the body to bring about calming. But when you smell a plant scent, that smell is these volatile organic compounds and it passes across your lung membrane into your blood. So people who walk in a pine-centred forest where they've done experiments shown that after walking for 20 minutes in a pine-centred forest, they had elevated levels of pineene in their blood. It's in the ambient air. But then what happens then is that pineene, once it's in the blood or some of these compounds, once they're in the blood, they act on biochemical pathways in the same way as if you took a prescription drug. So effectively, they are doing that biochemical work for you. So lavender is a really classic one. And with lavender, everyone says, oh, it's an old wives' tell. I now spread on my pillow and it's psychosomatic. I'm going to sleep no. Actually lavender itself, that compound, once it's in your blood, it works in the same way as taking an anti-anxiety drug. And when they put people in sleep chambers, if you puff out lavender, they're not only sleep for longer intervals, but they also have a deeper sleep. Well, if you ask me, are we at a point where we can actually prescribe specific aspects of nature? I think there's still going to be a lot more work done at it. But I would like to push back slightly to say what's coming through time and again, or population level studies, where they're looking at, you know, 900,000 people in the UK, people who live closer to green areas, taking into account all socioeconomic factors and everything else, cultural differences, etc., etc. People who live closer to green areas and have more trees on the streets have much, much better health outcomes. And these are not just mental health outcomes, it's cardiovascular, it's respiratory, it's all of these things. But of course, these are just correlations, they're not causation. So what they're now starting to say is why? What's going on? What is it about green space and urban green space in particular that's so important for these health outcomes? Because of course that leads directly through to budgets for health. And therefore, if you can find ways where you can replace a prescription drug with a nature-based solution, then that has to be a sort of win-win in terms of policy. There's a number of things in this. For example, they've done experiments with people who've done a task with green versus a task with another colour squared. Just leave aside plants time being, they find that green, you're more creative and much calmer. That triggers these. It's a calming colour. It is a calming colour. That's why you see many hospitals being painted green. But if you add into that, it's also the shape of vegetation that seems to be quite important. So for example, when you're looking, even just looking at a computer screen or looking out on the landscape, what the evidence is now showing is that it's a more open landscape with a few scattered trees, is the one that induces the greatest relaxation. So the first theory is this thing called the stress reduction theory, which is put forward by a man called Roger Orrick and others. They are environmental psychologists. They said we basically have two biologically pre-determined responses to viewing nature. First, we have a preference for nature and instinctively then pay attention to nature. But the second is when we do so, it leads to this more positively toned emotional state. And that automatically triggers these physiological responses that makes us calmer when we view natural scenes. But there's another thing that happens when we view natural scenes. When you look out of a window, you glance out of the window onto green. And then you go back to doing a task. You do better in the task. And it's called attention restoration theory. Our brains rely very heavily on cognitive resources that directly put the attention on a task. But the problem with that is that directed attention gets really worn out. But when you look at a green feast or look at nature, what happens is it's this bottom-up attention that comes in. Just you sort of glaze over it. And it gives your directed attention a break. And what they've shown is that that then means that when you go back to the task in hand, you're better at doing that task. So you're recovery rate from stress is faster. And they've shown it time and again. And there was a lovely study that was carried out in Spain. It was carried out in 2015 by a research professor in Barcelona Institute for Global Health. And the looked at 2,500 primary school children average age, 8 and 1,500 years. And they mapped the amount of green that they had when they walked into school and their route to school. And then they measured the amount of green from looking out at the classroom windows. And then they went back three times in the year and they tested children on particular maths and English and things, or Spanish or the presume. And what they found is regardless of your family background or your socioeconomic background, those children who see green from the classroom window, month on month, did better in the test scores. To the point there was a really big division by the end between those, the sea green to those that couldn't. And it wasn't the walking to school in the green. It was being able to see the green out the classroom window. Absolutely. I mean, it could be a very straightforward thing that every charge should be able to see green from their classroom window. And the other thing is, I mean, that's one study, but there are many, many other studies showing this in teenagers who are behaviors better and performance is better when children see green. Well, this was a really, really interesting study that's carried out where they had school children, again, or teenagers, looking at these. They had a planter. And in the planter they had those sort of yellow panses, which were real. And then they got them to look at the same planter with those, they're like polyester. They look very, very realistic. They're completely different reaction. They got full reaction with the real ones and not with the polyester ones. So some other sense is picking up that because they weren't told if they were real or plastic. And given this massive booming market in false plants, I mean, it does make you start to think about whether or not they are having any benefit. Yes. They seem to have this again effect, so our sort of automatic triggers in our bodies. So there are certain sounds that we hear birds on water rustling of trees that do indeed improve physiological and psychological measures of health. However, it's not all birds. So what they've shown is things like that really sharp sound of a crow or I was recently in Australia in the parakeets, terrible noise, those make people more stressed. Whereas the tuneful songbird, which isn't if you visualize the acoustic signature of a songbird, it's very sort of up and down. So those tuneful sounds are very, very good for us, but that you have got some fairly bad sounds as well. So there are many, many studies out there right now, but just to give you an example of the sort of the physiological benefits, there was one experiment where they looked at heart rate variability and brain activity of 66 participants. Who sat in this soundproof room, probably similar to this one, and listened to five minutes each of four sounds of forest with birds at dawn, waves on a beach and a calm sunny day, outdoor shopping streets and the cries of street vendors. And I can guess which ones are those exactly and that it's interesting is it because what it's showing is what we think we know is more often than not correct. But if you are trying to persuade somebody about the benefits of the good sound, we do a lot of policy on bad sound, we don't do much policy on good sound. And of course what they found statistically strong differences emerged. So within one minute of hearing the birdsong and the ocean sounds, the participants became physiologically calmer. So it's very, very quick, but also the longer they listened, the greater the reduction in marks of stress. So you can start to see that there's this data out there that is giving you these indications that you self do need because people say, well you know, we're going to put a road here that really doesn't matter. We still got the park, it doesn't matter. Yes, it does because the road noise directly impacts the effect of being able to hear nature and therefore directly impacts the physiological and psychological well-being benefits you all get from green space. Absolutely. Some of the big data studies on that are really quite worrying. So therefore, the other words have been going on particularly in Sweden where they've looked at, where's that threshold between where the road is and where the nature is and how much impact does the noise of the road have to have. And that's how we should be thinking about planning of opening green space. It might be great to have a small area. But if it's surrounded by very, very busy roads, then the benefits will be substantially reduced. So these studies have been carried out in a run. There's several studies they've done where people have been undergoing sort of epidurals. So they've been staying awake while having operation done on them. And they've either had headphones with bird sounds, headphones with no sounds or they can just hear the background sound. And they've asked them over 90 minutes of the experimenter every 10 minutes to give a pain score. And what they said very strongly was those people who could hear nature sounds water and birds had much lower pain scores. I find that really, really incredible. And again, I don't think people are entirely sure why that's the case, but it clearly is in there. Probably. I mean the studies on music playing music when you're working. It's no bad thing. It's no bad thing. But I think certainly if you play nature sounds it will certainly make you calm. I don't think it's as beneficial because you're only getting one interaction which is sight and I think what and sound if you're playing it on the headphones. But it's also the other senses. So for example, if you walk outside as well, then you're also smelling nature. And so therefore you're picking up all these other aspects of nature that you're not going to get when you sit inside. But the point I was trying to make in the book and certainly towards the last couple of chapters is you don't have to have a big green space outside your office to get the benefits of nature. You know, you should be thinking about how do you incorporate it into your everyday office environment. Well, there are two things in there that are really important and the first one is about smell. The one that's really, really interesting terms of smell is when we smell certain of the conifer family, particularly a cypress coupassacy, what happens there, there's a lovely experiment done a number of years ago now, where they had men sleeping in a room where they puffed out coupassacy for... It's a Japanese Hinoe key oil into the air for three nights. And these men slept in these hotel rooms for three nights and they measured their bloods and their urine and blood pressure, etc. What they found, first of all, significantly reduced the adrenaline hormones in their blood after three nights. Okay. But the second thing is they found significantly elevated natural killer cells in their bloods. Now, natural killer cells are the things that we all want higher levels because it attacks the cancerous and virus cells in our bodies. These are our first line of defense to these other really horrible things that can happen to us. And so that, to me, was a really, really interesting study because it seems to trigger something else in some metabolic process that we don't fully understand, but it seems to trigger that. Now, that study happened in 2009 and it didn't really get picked up till about the past couple of years and then there's a lovely, beautiful piece of what's done and published in the journal Oncology. So these are these sort of top medical journals which showed that when people walked in a cypress forest, the coupassacy, I think it was coupassacy forest, after two hours, they had elevated natural killer cells in their blood, significantly elevated natural killer cells in their blood. And not only is it kind of pharmaceutical? And not only that, seven days after they walked in the forest, they still had elevated levels. So they've given their immune system a massive boost by walking and smelling a coupassacy. And then they showed that people who live closer to these forests generally have much better health. So again, that's just the correlation, but if you then take that along with what happens when people walk in that forest, you start to realise that there is some very, very significant information in there about what happens when we smell different plant volatile compounds. It is, but you also have different effects. If you stroke a wood, it's much better to stroke unfinished wood. And it seems to be, you get a lower blood pressure. Why? I don't know. Well, you know, the people who've done this work, the original work that's done by people who are not biologists, people who work on kitchen furniture. Because you think about it when you go to buy a kitchen. The reason you want a wooden surface, you do. Most people go in, the first thing they do is they stroke the surface. And there's a lot of places where people walk in, they'll see a wooden table and they stroke it. Or people stroke tree trunks. I should see that out my window, and cue. People go up and they stroke the bark. Why? But actually what it shows is when you do that, for some reason that triggers a level of calming in your body. The soil was the other really big surprise when I did the research. This is to do with the environmental microbiome. So we have a huge drive now in this country to sort of eat less ultra processed food because it affects the microbiome in our gut. And that's incredibly important for health just for you know, which is incredibly important for health. What I hadn't realized until I did the research is, but the first thing is that the gut microbiome is fully mature by the age of about three or four. So everything after that and the 93% of our gut microbiome is totally influenced by the environment we're in and what we're eating. But when we go into nature, the more biodiversity nature, the higher its environmental microbiome, our gut and our skin and our breathing in, we adopt the environmental microbiome we're in. So people's gut microbiome is greatly improved when they're in a biodiversity environment and particularly with organic or natural soils. And the really interesting thing related to that is that then seems to reduce inflammatory markers in your blood. And the nicest study that did this and it's one that's been done in Finland over the last two years of very, very recent where they looked at kindergarten children. And they had three groups of children. One group just had the normal concrete. The second group had a sort of matting rubber matting. And the third group they put boreal forest soil for them to play in. And they measured their blood and they measured their poo and was looking at what's going on afterwards. And what they found that after 28 days, those that had been playing in the soil had a totally different gut flora as measured in their poo from the other two. Much, much better, great enhanced, really diverse gut flora. But they also found that they had these significantly reduced inflammatory markers in their blood. So effectively they had enhanced immune function. And it builds very much on from that. And this work was originally done with people who worked on that theory. And then this other one called the biodiversity hypothesis and the argument being we've got more and more of these immune diseases as we've had declining biodiversity. But then as an adult, what can you do? And there was another lovely study that was done where they put a green wall in an office. And then they measured these people's bloods and microbiome on their skin. And after 28 days, even a green wall in your office, it had seeded the room. And also those people who had the green wall and the office compared to no green wall had lower inflammatory markers in their bloods and greatly enhanced microbiome. So the green wall way you've got a number of plants. And you can even do that with another study. You just put a spider plant in a sealed room and went back six weeks later and found the spider plant. Just that one plant had seeded the walls, the floors, the ceiling of the room with this fantastic microbiome. So that's another thing where it's a hidden sense. And I call it hidden sense in the book because it's not something you can see or smell or taste. But it's absolutely there around us. And as we gradually start to understand this gut brain axis and how important it is, how much the gut really influences many of those autoimmune diseases in our body, this is why a biodiversity environment around us indoors and outdoors is really important. I don't think we know enough. But I think there is some really interesting question. I think right now, many people view humans or ourselves as outside of the ecosystem. But we are part of the Zika system. We are absolutely part of it. And by removing ourselves from it and taking nature and saying nature should be outside the cities in nature reserves, and we and cities should just be surrounded by concrete houses, we're just opening up a whole wealth of problems. Well, I believe within policy that we need to bring plants in as or nature in as another human right. In some ways, everybody rich poor, young old should have access to nature in their everyday lives. And that can be in their working place, in their homes, but also very close to where they live. Because the evidence space for those living green spaces, having a much better physical and mental well-being in both developed and less developed countries, it's very, very strong now. And in the United Nations COP, on biodiversity last year, they had a hundred and eighty nine countries signed up to it, which every citizen in those hundred and eighty nine countries should have access to green space for their health and well-being. But what we now need to say is, what does that green space look like? Because not all green spaces equal. Well, maybe I can just talk about myself having written this book. Yeah, what have you changed? Well, I used to be, you know, a sort of hard-nosed, bar-diversity scientist. And I now have, I mean, we have so many plants in our house now that I think my husbands think of moving out. But on my desk, different shapes, different colors, I also diffuse different volatile organic compounds. You know, you can buy little bottles of Hinokey oil, which is the one that elevates an actual killer cells when you smell it. So I now have a diffuser that does that. I have lavender in the bedroom. I have rosemary. It's something that keeps you alert and awake. I have that often in my office to keep me going and it works. And it works. So I think everyone can take responsibility themselves. You don't have to wait to be prescribed. And I think that's the other thing. But sadly, I think we're still quite a long way off having the right set of information to give GPs to say you can prescribe this particular treatment. Because we're catching up all the evidence-based catching up, but it's not there yet. So I think it would be naive to say it's fine. We can do this instead of that. But if I might just finish with one example, which was in Copenhagen where they have a therapy garden as part of the university, just green garden lots of plants in. And they looked at people who had been off sick from work for eight months. And half of them did cognitive behaviour therapy for ten weeks, for two hour sessions. The other half went into the garden for two hours a week. And what they found was that after these ten weeks that 70% of both those have been in the garden and those that have done the cognitive behavioural therapy were back at work. So that's great. But of course CBT, the cognitive behavioural therapy is much more expensive than someone going in the garden. But then they went back 18 months later. And it was a much higher percentage of those that have been in the garden for two hours a week were still back at work compared to the cognitive behavioural therapy. So there's a really interesting thing in there because it's shown the efficacy of the two things is the same. But one has longer term benefits. It completely changed, completely changed your relationship with nature. That's really interesting. I mean, first of all, as a paleoicologist, you're always looking at dead things on a page or down a microscope. Really beautiful, but actually, you know, in the very deep distant past. And then as director of science at Cue, we're doing the state of the world's plants, but it's all really big scale stuff, but still very academic. But now I'm always, you know, just been to various Botanic Gardens and I'm always going to touch in the plants, smelling the plants. It's not about what species is it or what's its evolution of history. It's what does it smell like? What does it feel like? How does it make me feel? Very, very different relationship to nature now than I had five years ago on a starting book. It's an absolute pleasure. Thank you. You The Economist CNN can report that Hillary Clinton has called Donald Trump to concede the race. She is called Donald Trump to say that she will not be president and I'm not sure the exact words, but probably to congratulate a president-elect Donald Trump. Harris has this four-point lead nationwide, but there's seven or so states that we think the election will mostly come down to. Wall Street would probably be a little bit more happy with Trump. If you look at three month returns, they have been better under Republican White House, whereas 12 month returns have been better under a Democrat-led White House. Hi, Alice. No, indeed. And they've left quite big shoes to fill. I mean, obviously, I guess in Mike's case, physically, they're kind of fairly small shoes, but metaphorically, they are big shoes, and I'll try to do my best. Right. And it's really interesting, because at some level, there is a degree of foreknowledge, and that both candidates have been in office. Trump, of course, was president for four years from 2016, and Harris was vice president under Biden for the past four years. So we have some sense of what they want to do. The economy today is in a very different place to what it was four years or eight years ago, and the effects of their policies could end up being very different as well. That's right. Because over the last four years, America has had the strongest recovery of all advanced nations. There's also been a bit of a productivity boom. Of course, where things are right now is that growth is slowing down. The inflation surge of the past few years is finally abating, but not fully vanquished yet. You've got a Fed that's starting to cut rates. Deficits are incredibly high, 7% of GDP, and there's lots of market worries about the fiscal side as a result. Trump has said that he will end inflation, which that's certainly credible, given that inflation itself is ending. I get less credibly and sort of a bit more hyperbolic, as he tends to do. He said that he will once more build the strongest economy ever. The trouble, I suppose, is that if you look at a lot of his policies, they may actually get rather than ending inflation, end up kicking it a little bit higher, and in fact, weakening the economy. So in broad strokes, he's promised universal tariffs on all imports into America, trillions and trillions of dollars in tax cuts, which would really exacerbate the fiscal deficit, as well as mass deportation of immigrants. All of these things could push up prices, could weaken growth. I suppose a bit more positively from a market's perspective. He's also talked about slashing regulation. Her policies are, frankly speaking, a little bit willier at this point in time. Her catchphrase is that she talks about building a quote unquote opportunity economy. What that refers to is some combination of programs to make housing more affordable, potentially to ban price gouging on groceries, especially in times of emergency, to cap costs on prescription drugs, higher taxes on the wealthy and companies, lower taxes, more tax credits for low and middle income Americans, especially families. OK, I look forward to that. Thank you for having me. So what happened immediately after Joe Biden withdrew from the race? I found very surprising. It was a very rapid consolidation of the nomination by Kamala Harris. There was very little kind of contention within the Democratic Party. And almost immediately, Democrats polls improved. So on the day that she became their kind of presumptive nominee, Harris and Trump were tied nationwide. So there was a slight improvement over Joe Biden's position. And her lead since then has grown quite a lot. So today, our poll tracker gives her a four point lead nationwide. And there's kind of a few things that have contributed to that. She had a very favorable rollout where the media was excited that there was a new candidate and she was getting very positive coverage. She had a very successful debate. She was perceived to have chosen a good vice presidential nominee. And so it's been a kind of string of success for Harris in national news, which means she's really improved the Democrats polling position. Yes. So Harris has this four point lead nationwide. But there's seven or so states that we think the election will mostly come down to. The most likely pivotal states and those are much tighter. So our presidential forecast estimates that Pennsylvania is the most likely state to be the so-called tipping point and give one candidate the 270th vote they need to win the electoral college. And in Pennsylvania at the moment, we have Harris with a 1.2 percentage point lead. So Pennsylvania is very narrow and it is essentially a toss up. So we think Harris has a very good chance of winning the nationwide popular vote. But we're calling the electoral college essentially still a toss up. So our forecast today gives Harris a 57% chance of winning the election overall. Yes, so we have our presidential forecast published, but our congressional forecast is still in the works. So everything I'm saying now is a kind of quantitatively informed guess, but it's not a model, it's not a forecast. But Democrats have a fairly good chance of winning the House. We would probably say it's roughly a toss up. So the House of Representatives, Republicans have had slight advantage in the past, but it generally leans in a kind of similar way to their presidential election. So if Harris wins the presidency, I would guess that she has a fairly good chance of also winning the House. The Senate on the other hand, this year happens to have a particularly unfavorable map for the Democrats. And in order to win control of the Senate overall, they'll probably have to hold on to Senate seats in quite red states like Ohio or Montana, or even win some from the Republicans in states like Texas or Florida, which lean quite substantially to the right compared to the country as a whole. So there's still a chance that they could win, but it's much less likely that Democrats hold on to the Senate. So I think if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, I think there's a decent chance that she will face Republicans opposing her in the Senate. Whereas if Donald Trump wins the presidency, I think there's a good chance they will win a trifecta and have both houses of Congress supporting his legislation. Thank you. Hi, Joe. Hi, Alice. Thanks for having me on. You know, I don't think you're going to get that 2016 style because that was certainly a shock to the system. I think most people did not expect the way it turned out there. For this time, I think it's kind of 50-50 and people don't know what to expect. So you're not going to shock them either way. And frankly, we've had Trump as president for four years. So people kind of know what they're getting is volatile as that might be. He's not an unknown quantity anymore. Where back then, everybody just assumed the worst and things got crazy pretty quickly. So I don't think you'd get anywhere near the volatility head back then. I think, as you mentioned from 2016, we probably learned a lesson because anybody who's trying to predict the trade, it's difficult. And you could probably tell them right now who's going to win and it still may not work out. I mean, obviously some of the trades may people may be thinking are things like energy, oil and gas related types of sectors, banks, and so on. Any sort of pro business policies that would be good. All cap stocks actually, I think you're going to well either way as interest rates start to come down, which they're extremely reliant on. But when it comes to the policies, what's interesting now is that the candidates are kind of morphing into a similar style. You keep hearing all sorts of giveaways or policies where people would not pay for them. And usually Republicans are a little bit more conservative. There's not going to be that big trade put on, I think. I think what you're looking at is more of a regulatory situation where the democratic candidate traditionally, and it appears this one as well, are more pro regulation. So in that, I think you would see Wall Street not necessarily like that. Wall Street hates regulation in general. No, less rules are better for them, right? But that's not the best policy a lot of times. If you look at what happened during the Trump years, it really came down to the judges and what's been going on lately. So for instance, the Supreme Court recently ruled six three in favor of the Chevron case. It's known as the Chevron, which basically kind of neutered some of the agencies like the FTC, the FCC and the FCC. And when I say neutered, I mean that they can be challenged on the rules that are being formed. So these types of anti-regulatory stances might be good for some companies and it might be bad for others. But I think people are looking at that saying, okay, if it was a Trump presidency, we'll get less regulation. And if it's a Harris presidency, we might get more. Nobody's going to be happy with either one. So that's the way we are right now. No one's happy. So Wall Street would probably be a little bit more happy with Trump. The one concern and a big concern are the tariffs. While tariffs are a revenue raising situation for the government and it would be in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff revenues, which is essentially attacks, right? It is also something that is anti-growth and it could stunt companies growth and it could close economic problems. So they are very, very concerned that Mr. Trump is talking about 10 to 20% tariffs across the board. That's nothing the economists will talk about in the 1920s and smooth haulie will cause the great depression and that's scary. I don't think nobody wants to see that. But on the other side, the Biden-Harris administration hasn't taken the tariffs off of China. So they're not exactly anti-tariffs. Thank you for having me, Alice. It was my pleasure. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right, Alice. And so that's the uncertainty about how the market processes everything. I think even just looking at the political side of things, you also have so many layers of uncertainty. And I think Owen laid that out very well. And first and most obvious is who wins the presidency. Next you have the question of whether or not they'll have a divided Congress, which will obviously obstruct their agenda. But say you do get to one of the more clean cut scenarios where you get that surprise of a Republican sweep or even a bigger surprise given the math around the Senate of a democratic sweep. You still have uncertainty about what they actually would be able to do from the White House because they would not be unencumbered. Why their Trump or Harris would still be looking at the flimsiest of majorities in the Senate. And we saw what that meant in terms of Joe Manchin constraining and then ultimately enabling part of the Biden agenda. But in the Trump world, that means that the balance of power would be held by a non-Maga Republican. Say somebody like Susan Collins for Maine, or in the case of Kamala Harris, it would be a centrist Democrat. Say kind of the next incarnation of Joe Manchin. That might be Sherrod Brown from Ohio, for example, if he manages to win his race. So I think given all of that, it's not all that surprising that the market is relatively sanguine about what you might term to be radical ideas from both presidential candidates, especially Trump who has some ideas that would just be so incredibly damaging for the economy if he were actually to do mass deportations of immigrants or to do extreme universal tariffs. And yet market participants like Joe, they seem to sort of be discounting the prospects of that. And I don't think it's that they have their head in the sand. I think they're just being realistic about how much damage either candidate could actually Lovely to speak to you again, Alice Hayden. Yeah, so we've looked at elections history over the last 100 years and there isn't a big statistical difference between a normal years equity returns and an election year is equity returns. There's a difference of about 1 to 2% where in election years you sometimes see slightly better returns than you do in normal years. And again, history, it rhymes, it doesn't necessarily repeat. But we do find that if you look at three month returns, they have been better under a Republican White House, whereas 12 month returns have been better under a Democrat-led White House. The exceptions are the ones that are more interesting, but that has been the average over time. So there's not much to choose between non-election years and election years, but what is more interesting is the difference in the three month and the 12 month returns. There's a possibility of that. I mean, that's what the market would suggest that you initially get quite excited about it and then the reality of perhaps spending or taxes or inflation sometimes pans out to be slightly different. But again, some of these averages are defined by extreme outliers. I do think that in the present situation, if you were to see the White House once again being led by a Democrat, if Kamala Harris were to win, then that would be more in line with status quo. There's a possibility that initially the markets worry about high taxation, but on a 12 month horizon, we think that a Democrat president in this case could actually be a better outturn for the markets than a Republican president. I think the market disagrees. Most of our investors completely disagree. So the reason I mentioned those historical patterns is because we think that is quite relevant for this election as well. Yeah. So, if we were to keep it reasonably simple, I think the markets expecting higher nominal GDP under Trump. Right? So, they think growth will improve. The thing inflation might pick up a little bit, but growth will improve because they see the fiscal lever as being exerted even further. So, you would recall that Trump in the 2017 Jobs Act had reduced corporate taxes to 21% and the view is that he's going to reduce corporate taxes to 15%. Well, that's what his platform is saying. But if you look at the market and what's priced in, the market is expecting really is a Republican victory. And you can tell that from looking at pre-tax and post-tax earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026. And the tax rate of the markets expecting is about 19% in 2019. So, they're definitely not expecting a pick-up in taxes. They're expecting a further reduction in taxes, which really sounds like the markets expecting definitely a Republican president, potentially a red sweep. What is also true is that when you track some sectors which are going to benefit from a Democrat president, such as renewables and other sectors that are going to benefit from a Republican president, such as financials because of deregulation, and you look at a basket of stocks that is going to benefit from one relative to the other, year-to-date a Republican victory is being better priced in these baskets of stocks. It's a very important point because if you were to get a Democrat president, but the Senate was to shift Republican the probability of which is at least 60% according to polls, then the possibility of a serious increase in taxation for corporates from 21%, potentially to 28%, which is what Kamala Harris and her platform have spoken about, that probability diminishes. So it is actually a damning indictment of American politics that in fact the best case outcome for the markets would be one where you have stasis where you don't get a Republican president who imposes 60% tariffs on China or in 10% tariffs on all imports across the world, but you also are unable to raise corporate taxes to 28%. So if you get a Democrat president, but you get a divided Congress specifically, the Senate is Republican, that might be the least worst outcome for the markets. I think if you were to get a red sweep and I think the markets will react quite positively on a three month horizon under a red sweep, but I think they will give that back, which is where our view differs from investors. The most important reason, Alice, is that the economy is in a different place, right? The economy is much more laid cycle today than it was in 2016. What does laid cycle mean? What does the jargon mean? Lately cycle basically means that the output gap is closed and the possibility of corporates being able to increase margins and earnings without creating further inflation is very low. In 2016, the economy was still early cycle to mid cycle. Today the economy is much more laid cycle. That's one major difference. There are several others which I think are worth mentioning. Public debt in the US is about 25 percentage points higher relative to GDP than it was in 2016. And under both a Democrat and a Republican president, the Congressional Budgetary Office actually does expect a significant pick up in public debt from here in any case, except in a red sweep relative to the baseline of the CBO. It's likely to pick up by a further $4 trillion. So the possibility of the cost of capital staying high, even if the Fed cuts, which means of the 10 year rate, potentially stays high, even if the Fed cuts because there's so much supply of paper, the public debt increases in such a substantial fashion. I think that possibility is very high. You should take that into consideration. And thirdly and perhaps most importantly, the risk premia are already very tight today compared to 2016. Today, high-ill credit spreads sit almost at the tightest eb of their distribution. In simple terms, equity valuations and credit valuations are already very high ahead of the election that was not the case previously. And lastly, I would point out to what Trump has spoken about in terms of tariffs. We don't know if they will fully implement what they are saying. So just to be clear, what they're saying is 10% tariffs across the board, 60% tariffs in China. But if you were to implement that, that's about three to four times in weighted average GDP terms, three to four times the amount of tariffs they spoke about are they implemented between 2016 and 2020. So this is a significant increase in tariffs. So in our minds, the growth inflation mix is likely to be much worse under this Republican Red Sweep, where we do see one compared to 2016. It's going to be more of the status quo. So before I speak about the Democrat win and sort of contrast with the Republican, when I should say that the fact that we are a late cycle is more pertinent than anything else. I think the state of the economy, where it is in the cycle, the state of risk premium, how tight they are, they will matter more for returns in 2025 than who's in the White House. Now, if we were to get a Democrat White House, depending on what happens to the Congress, but let's say the Congress is split, which is the market space case, and we get a Democrat White House, in that case, we probably don't get the increase in taxation as the market may initially fear. So the initial response would be an increase in corporate taxes and increase in taxation for rich individuals, both in terms of capital gains tax and also in income tax, and that might lead to a correction in the market. But eventually, I think the market will wake up, and as a result of that, the market will begin once again to recover, we think. It's not going to do as well as it has done in the last 18 months, because, again, very different nominal GDP environment, but I think that would be positive. What I think would be quite interesting is that if we do get a continuation of the status quo in terms of policies and the economy is late cycle and over time inflation is declining, the possibility of the Fed cutting rates much deeper is higher under a Democrat presidency, and that will mean that the dollar can potentially sell off more or the dollar can weaken more under a Democrat president than under a Republican president. And that's quite ironic, because lots of folks in the Trump campaign have spoken about the need for a weaker dollar, but they will unlikely be able to weaken the dollar, because they're going to put more pressure on the rest of the world. You're right, Alice, to say that historically, Democrat presidents have been more associated with fiscal largest and make no mistake, even under the next Democrat president, you will likely see very large spending, right? The difference this time is that the kind of fiscal expansion that we're seeing under a Republican president is not what you usually see. So just to give some numbers, and these numbers are scary, let me warn you, since the US first issued public debt, till today, about 235 years, US public debt has gone up by 27 trillion. We will almost double that, so another 27 trillion dollars of public debt just in the next 10 years. At a time when global savings, which is what buys this public debt, are not growing at nearly the same pace as they were growing at a time when Benanki sort of gave us this thesis about global savings, glut, in sort of the mid-2000s. There is no global savings glut now. So the pace of global savings, which is the demand stock for this supply, is growing in a much slower pace at a time when the supply is increasing in a big way. Under a Democrat president, you could see the public debt number go up by an additional, and the additional is a key point, an additional two trillion dollars over the next 10 years, whereas under a red sweep, you could see it go up by as much as 4.1 to 4.5 trillion dollars incremental to the baseline, where the baseline is already expecting almost an exponential increase in public debt. So that's pretty scary, and many people run with that and they say, oh, that means that the dollar is going to be completely debased, and we have to sell the dollar very aggressively as a result of that. I think the conclusion on the dollar is incorrect, but the reality of high cost of capital at the long end in the US is probably true and still being underpriced. Lovely to speak to you, Alice. All the best. Well, Alice, my money is unpurple. That is, not on the blue states or the red states, but on the United States and America. Powering on is that always seems to do. Okay, that's kind of corny, but on a serious note. I found Bannu's comments really kind of illuminated theoretical quandary, which is on the one hand, you know, you begin to have that micro economic analysis, if you will, where you can look at basket of Trump-favored stocks, like oil companies doing better than a basket of Harris-favored stocks, like renewables and EVs. And at the micro level, that seems to reflect almost quasi-efficient market pricing and that you've got the market pricing in the potential sectoral benefits of a Trump victory. But then you have Bannu laying out how there are so many macro risks that would be involved in Trump victory, higher inflation, higher rates, higher risk, premium, and he's certainly not alone in that viewpoint. So if you take that perspective, then you've got a market that's doing a terrible job of pricing in the macro risks. And so you're kind of left with this odd theoretical position where you've got a market that at the micro level seems to be efficient, but at the macro level is incredibly inefficient. The big picture, though, I think it's worth stepping back for a second is that when it looked like Trump was cruising to a victory over Biden, American stocks were doing very well, American risk assets were doing very well. Now that it's looking like a much tighter race, quite possibly favoring Harris, the market is still doing extraordinarily well. It's hitting new highs almost every day. So I think it's tempting to look at that and say that actually it's really not sensible to trade the election. It doesn't really matter much to markets or more fundamentally the economy at all. That's far too glib of a view because I think if you look at the big, big shift in American policy over the last decade, you think back to 2016, had Trump not won, America probably would not have ended up in a trade war with China, certainly not the same type of trade war that we got. If Biden hadn't won in 2020, America would not have gone so heavy on industrial policies. So we're talking about very, very big forks in the road for American policy and more broadly for the American economy and the global economy. And what will come out of 2024? It's hard to say for sure, but we know that if it is Trump, probably there will be a lot more emphasis on tariffs. And if it is Harris, there probably will be quite the expansion of the welfare state. You can't necessarily price that into the stock market today, but these are far reaching economic consequences. Well, indeed, and clearly that would not be great for markets. It would not be great for the economy. I suppose we're in the unique position of where a little bit of Trump versus Fed would not be bad for a financial journalist. We'd have a lot to talk about, a lot to say. And so I wouldn't wish that upon America, but American journalists might relish the moment. Well, I do have a stat. I did not listen to Money Talk's last week or the week before. So hopefully this is not a stat that was trotted out. But here we go. And the number is 2%. Well, I mean, this is going to begin to give it away, but I'll say 2% is the yield. But the yield on what is the question? Can I stop you there? Yeah. That is such a good guess. And that it's actually yields on Chinese government 10-year bonds. And they touched an all-time low of 2% this week, which is one of the reasons that the PBOC and concert with other authorities unveiled what they hope is going to be a big stimulus package to get the economy going again. But it really is symbolic of the concern that China is turning Japanese, the fact that yields have gotten as low as they have. And I think many market participants expect that they'll be headed towards zero, kind of intrually into Japanese territory. Because even with the stimulus, you still have, if you look at producer price inflation, it's gone negative 2%. So real interest rates are actually still far, far from being stimulative in China. And I think it's a marker of how much the economy has slowed. And by the way, the Japanese comparison, Japanese yields on 10 years were 2% in the late 1990s. So in terms of China turning Japanese, you could kind of set it back to the late 1990s for where China stands today to be quite crude with that analysis. I'm trying to rack my mind for companies that had their results announced this week. Yeah, are we talking about Nvidia's profit margin? Yeah, it is amazing when you think, you know, one industry that as far as the user is concerned has been massively disrupted in the last five years in America has been payments. It's almost unrecognizable the way that we buy and pay for things today compared to just five years ago. And one would have thought that for big lumbering incumbents, that kind of disruption would have shaken the profit margin a little bit, it's amazing that it hasn't. It's been a real pleasure, Alice, thank you. And thank you for listening to Money Talks. Today's show was produced by Dan Asher and Marie Kiworth. And the executive producer is Hannah Moreno. I'm Simon Irvinga-Vitch. Nazrallah was not a bad person. He was a bad person. He was a thief of the same kind. The mood in Beirut is one of tension, I'd say. We're seeing most of these attacks focused on the Dahia, which is the southern suburbs where traditionally Hasbalaq had drawn a lot of support. They've become a standard part of the city's soundscape now. Access into Dahiaq is quite difficult and quite fraught with risk at the minute. There's lots of stories about journalists being beaten up. I think Hasbalaq and the people still remaining in Dahia are immensely suspicious of foreigners, of journalists, and especially of foreign media. So it's not so easy to go there. But what you can see is the displaced people, literally on the street where I live, there's essentially people sleeping on cardboard boxes. If you go to the main squares, people are sleeping on mattresses, people slept on the beach, the last few nights as well. To some degree, it's Bedlam. People really have nowhere else to go. And it seems that there's airstrikes happening every 12 hours or so, sometimes even more regularly. And you can hear them. I heard the strike on Friday night, which killed Hasen, the Zerollah. It was nearly three miles away from my house. But it shook the windows, it shook the building. And I think it jolted the whole city awake. To give you an idea of the scale of this crisis, Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Miati came out and said that almost a million people have been displaced. This is the largest displacement crisis in Lebanon's history. I think Hasen, Hasen, has capacity to respond is the big question here. Historically speaking, they have prided themselves and taken strength on their discipline and secrecy as an organization. And I think even before this conflict, our understandings of their internal workings and their military capabilities were limited. And I think it's clear now that they're in disarray. They've gone quiet. It took them 24 hours to wish you a statement about Hasen, Nazrullah's killing. So there's this silence around Hasbullah. They've obviously lost a lot of senior commanders, senior leadership. And with Nazrullah's death, they now have to choose a new secretary general. And I think this is probably the first time in several decades that you've noticed a sort of absence of Hasbullah. They're probably weaker than they've been for 20 years, and that's what's shocking about it. Now, do they have the capacity to respond how many of their long-range precision guided missiles have Israel taken out over the past few weeks? We don't know for sure, but if they still have significant capabilities to attack Israel, then you would expect to see them used within the coming days or weeks. Because I think for their own credibility, they need to mount a response to everything that's happened in the last two weeks. And to be frank, there's no sign of that at the minute. This is basically Israel's moment to try and take out as many high-level targets, whether it's senior commanders of Hasbullah and also of other organizations. The Hamas commander-in-lebanan was assassinated yesterday as well, and as much of the military infrastructure, any part of the network that Israel knows about. This is the moment to take them out because Hasbullah, a present can barely respond. We have seen, of course, every few hours of the salvo of short-range Hasbullah rockets being fired from southern Lebanon towards Israeli towns in the north of Israel. But that so far is pretty minimal, and that's not the big response that everyone was worried about. This was actually the second Israeli air strike against the Hodeh-a-Port on the coast of Yemen. And this comes after Houthi missiles being fired by the Houthis. And I don't think this is yet a full-scale offensive against the Houthis, and that's the kind of thing which is very difficult to launch with that distance between Israel and Yemen. But it's a response to the Houthis joining in as part of what the Iranians planned as a sort of ring of fire around Israel. And his bullet has been almost taken out of that ring, but other members are trying to join in, and this is Israel's response to that. We're hearing two different things from Biden and his administration. On the one hand after Nasrallah's assassination, both Joe Biden and his deputy and Houthi, and the Kamala Harris put out statements saying that Nasrallah's death had been a measure of justice for his victims, many American victims, Israeli victims, Lebanese victims, many people that have killed over the years. So that seemed to be a degree of approval for what Israel did on Friday. On the other hand, he saw Biden saying yesterday that he's calling for a ceasefire. He doesn't want to see all out war, so we don't really see it a clear American position here. Up until a few days ago, the official Israeli war aim was to allow Israeli civilians who forced to flee northern Israel because of his brother rockets to return to their home safely. There was no mention of dismantling Israel taking out its leadership and so on. So how Israel sees the end game has yet to be clarified. Will the accept proposal for a ceasefire if that is actually on the table? Because so far, this is just talk we don't know an actual ceasefire proposal. Will they accept that? Or will Israel continue pursuing its advantage now that Israel is on the back foot and try and take out as much of Israel's infrastructure as possible? Until accepting a ceasefire. That could include more airstrikes which we have been seeing and we saw this morning as well. Or it could even include a ground invasion with seeing tanks being prepared near the northern border. We know that at least to Israeli divisions have been moved up to the border. It's certainly an option being considered now in Israel. Well, so far we've been seeing a diplomatic charm offensive from Iran saying we don't want to war with Israel. We're prepared to put down our arms if Israel puts down its arms as well. And we've still been waiting for nearly two months now for an Iranian response to the assassination of Ismail Hania, the Hamas political chief in Tehran by Israel. And it looks like Iran may be about to cut its losses. Iran invested billions in building up the arsenal. But I was Iran's most important proxy in the region and now they're seeing this investment going up in smoke literally. One Israeli official said to me that the attack that you mentioned earlier on Hodeid report, the Yemen report, is actually a warning towards Iran. Iran's oil terminals and infrastructure are not even closer to Israel. So you could possibly carry out that kind of an attack and I think that the Iranians are very wary of that happening. On the question of Iran, I think it's something you hear a lot in Lebanon at the minute. There's certainly a rumor that the Iranians have thrown his baller under the bus. And when we talk about this quite staggering Israeli infiltration of his baller, you hear a lot of people blaming the Iranians. And perhaps this is how Israel has managed to decapitate as ballers leadership that Iran has somehow the source of the leaks, the information, the intelligence. I was told a very interesting analogy by one prominent Lebanese thinker who described the relationship between Iran and its proxies. Imagine a president surrounded by their bodyguards. In this instance, his baller is the bodyguard and the Islamic revolutionary guard corps in Iran is the president. It is the bodyguard's duty to protect the president, but it is not necessarily the president's duty to protect the bodyguards. And so I think when you look at it like that, I'm still more skeptical of Iran being drawn into this wider conflict with Israel and possibly even America. And Angela mentions this diplomatic charm offensive, I think it also points in that direction. Thank you. Thank you for having us, Rosie. So I have been to quite a few media conferences over the years, but this one was different and it was different right from the beginning. There was the usual procession of people lining up to sign in, grab those nice landmyards that always have your name tag on them. But on the table, there were two piles of landmyards. One was blue and it had the conference name on it, totally standard, but then the other pile of landmyards was red and it was marked no photo. These were for the journalists that have to be shielded from sight. And in this group, there were quite a few of those people because this conference I was presenting at was hosted by press club Belarus. And attendees were all Belarusian journalists who have been working in exile for nearly four years. I did. I spoke to a number of people actually, but I was really struck by this one girl in her 20s. And she called it Belarusian paranoia. Something she said that existed ever since she fled her home in 2020, but it's been getting a lot worse recently, she said. The government has labeled independent media as extremists and as such, Belarusian journalists were arrested. But she says that because she still has family back in the country, she fears for their safety still. So we'll go back to 2020 at least. In that summer, in August, Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a general election with 80% of the vote. Now, Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, but this election was still largely seen as fraudulent and under the thumb of Russia. So following that election, there were weeks of anti-Lukashenko protests with thousands taking to the streets day after day, week after week. But then increasingly, the crackdown started. Started with hundreds being arrested. And then it escalated to police brutality, beatings of protesters and the deployment of tear gas and grenades. It was then that the regime of repression really took root. So athletes, lawyers, activists, opposition politicians and journalists all started being arrested and by early 2021, most had fled the country and they've been living in exile ever since. And maybe just to offer you a bit of an example is to what that repression looked like. In May 2021, President Lukashenko forced Orion Air passenger plane flying from Greece to Lithuania just through Belarusian airspace. He forced it to land in the capital in Minsk so that authorities could arrest a journalist on board. And it's not really gotten any better since then. August marked four years since that fraudulent election took place and the International Federation of Journalists is still making calls for the release of what they say is 37 media workers who remain behind bars in that country. It was interesting to be in a place of those individuals coming together because they're all living in exile but they're not living in exile in one place. This conference was hosted in Warsaw but other people live in Lithuania. I met a couple people who live in Ukraine even and they refused to be displaced for a second time once the war there started. So it really was a coming together, there was a sense of community and I think they really need it for one to have the camaraderie of knowing that you're not in this alone but also because the obstacles they all face are so similar and they're ever changing. And this is what one of the organizers for the event had to say about it. We're just going to call her Elena. We're still journalists now even more than ever because we have this regime, especially when Belarus involved to war in Ukraine. So there is a certain sense of duty there but also she and others are talking about those big challenges that they're facing. Maybe it's strange but I would say it's interesting. You know all of us read about Cold War or Soviet Union times about so-called Russian dissidents, people who try to be free anyway. And now we have almost the same situation and it's hard but at the same time it's interesting time to live really when you try to. When I asked Elena if I could maybe speak to someone who had been arrested in the last few years she says it's hard to even remember because there were just so many. Yeah a number of them in that room and I did manage to speak to one of those individuals and we won't name her for reasons that will become abundantly clear as I tell you her story. But she was a very well known journalist in Belarus before she was arrested and then held in prison for a year before she was released. And a condition of her release was that she stopped working as a journalist at all which of course she didn't do. Big part of my family stay in Belarus and they aren't in safety. I've noticed the no photo. No photo because photo is one of a reason to arrested the people in Belarus who are in the lie detector. Hostages. Hostages. So yeah in case that audio isn't super clear. After this journalist fled the country she was seen in photos abroad continuing her work and then her family who remained in Belarus was also arrested. And yet she still refuses to stop. She just takes different precautions now. When we are working from exile it became more and more important. Maybe it wasn't so important when you were free too. Yeah that form really jailed journalist I spoke to said that their estimates are that approximately 30% of the population within Belarus are still managing to access at least some level of independent news. So that's a big success for them. And what else I found was that because the government has labeled them as extremists they kind of had started embracing that title they called themselves extremists all over the time. And it kind of blanketed that whole idea that they are doing something brave they are fighting for something and they are very hopeful that eventually there will be a free press in Belarus. If I don't have hope I can't to continue my work I am sure I'm not sure what I will see it but I'm sure it will come. Thanks Jason. Hi I hope you know who I am. So we're here to play this very popular Chinese card game called Guangdong roughly translated to English it means throwing eggs or throwing bombs. So part of the game involves coming up with different combinations they're called bombs and so when you tried to change the card combinations that everyone's playing you say, but because that bomb rhymes with the word for egg that did that hence it becomes throwing eggs I see. Yeah so actually I'll just kind of explain some general rules so each player you're glad 27 cards you have four players divided to teams and essentially the goal of this is for a team to play all their cards before the other team. The first thing we do is each player we arrange our cards by rank the joke goes out of highest then you have two ace and then king queen Jack in all the way to three so kind of three is a lowest and the joke was on the biggest somewhat counter intuitive for a two to be higher than a three or indeed an ace. I'm not entirely sure but I think it's meant to sort of mess with you a little bit. Wait who? That's a bomb. That's a bomb. That's a bomb. Okay okay. In different parts of China they have their own local card game but this is from the Zhangsu province and if you go to Zhangsu and you see on local television they will have people playing this in tournaments. It's just that in the past couple years it became a national phenomenon and that really started in a public sector. A lot of civil servants were playing this sometimes at work, sometimes after work. And it's becoming a staple in banquets and dinners. So the rumor is that quite a few Chinese leaders really like playing this game. That's kind of how it started in the public sector or amongst the civil servants that certain superiors or people in higher ups like playing this. Now it's people in the public sector play it but also state no enterprises and not even private companies play it. From what I read the game's been popular in Huayan and Zhangsu for quite a while. They became the intangible cultural heritage of Huayan in 2014. A lot of people and this is just one version of why people say it's become popular. Is that a lot of foreign businesses are leaving China and people used to play a lot more Texas hold them and more westernized games along with their banquets and dinners. And now because they're having to deal with more sort of state-owned enterprise people and officials. This regional game, a very Chinese game has taken hold. Yeah, people still play that but I think Guangdong is less associated with people playing parks and more associated with business meetings or post-business meetings or it's associated with more formal occasions. It's one of those things that people play at work and hence now you have people criticizing it as an example of a laying flat culture. Yeah, so reluctance to work and put an effort in life in general. A lot of young people say they're laying flat because they don't want to work hard. They think life is more important than work. And games are more fun than work. And games are more fun and more rewarding actually. And actually it's a reflection of kind of the broader economic problems in China which is a lot of young people would say actually even increasingly older people would say if I put an hour is in a work a lot I still wouldn't necessarily get a promotion or necessarily get a better job. So why do it if my economic prospects are not going to improve why work hard I just lay flat. Bye. The Economist There's now a report that a Canadian has been detained in China. We're talking about a former diplomat for this country. We have a picture of him for you right here as name is Michael Coghry. When it happened to me as it happened to me, I had a very acute, almost quiet-minded sense of living through my worst-case scenario. They pushed me into the SUV and just as I was disappearing into it, I looked back and I partner and I looked at each other and I just tried to send her a signal that, you know, take care of yourself, take care of our baby, get help. I will get out of this. They just shoved me into the backseat, handcuffed me, blindfolded me, officers sat on either side of me. And if you've never been handcuffed in a situation, that kind of icy metallic feel of handcuffs closing around your wrists is a very disturbing sensation. Part of the horror of it is that it imposes on you a completely different identity. We spend our lifetimes kind of developing a sense of who we are. Those handcuffs get slapped on you and suddenly there's an implication that you're a wrong doer. Canada may now be caught up in the fight between China and Washington, a diplomatic dispute that could drag this country into the trade war between the two superpowers. Coronavirus has taken a toll on two Canadian citizens stuck in a prison in China for the last 500 days. It has been a thousand days since Michael Spavre and Michael Coghryx were detained by the Chinese government. The interrogator sitting at the desk on that day he had a single piece of paper from which he read from in a monotone voice. Four days ago, your partner gave birth to a baby girl. Your and daughter are healthy. That's all I have for you today. You get to open walks out and leave to me sitting in the chair for the rest of the morning, locked into it. I'm a big city guy, so I found the energy and intensity and complexity of Beijing fascinating and very energizing. One of the most useful things that I did as a diplomat in terms of trying to get to know Chinese people, I joined a couple of wine appreciation societies. I like to go a lot to little music bars and jazz bars. But that's one thing that strikes you about Beijing also for a city of its size, these sort of informal culture, the culture of the people there. Music, other performances, entertainment is really thin on the ground. But at least, yeah, in 2014 there was still a lot of fun and interesting things to do that way. It also had an interesting art scene. And I tried for diversity to try to get involved in those things, but also because those were good ways of meeting people and just immersing yourself in Chinese culture, partly because it was so hard to have meaningful conversations in official meetings. This was in the Sunleetswin area, which is one of the most modern kind of commercial gleaming parts of Beijing. Half the time, if you wanted to go see Chinese contacts you wanted to talk to, you had to fight your way through Beijing traffic and cross half the city and back. So that in itself, just logistics were exhausting in the city. The other is that it's a city where everything seems to be too big for a normal human scale. If you've ever walked into the Ministry of Public Security, you stand in front of it, and you walk into that lobby, that very building essentially says to you, you are a bug in front of the state. The state is huge and mighty. You would dream to challenge the state, think again. The blocks in Beijing from an urban planning perspective are too long, right? Because everything is divided into these walled off sort of shallots you. If you're trying to get from point A to point B walking, you've got very long blocks to cross. The main reason that I took the job with crisis group, the timing was ideal for me. When I was finishing my diplomatic posting, it became existentially clear to me that we were heading into a world where, at best, we were going to have a very intense rivalry between China and the US and its allies. At worst, we could have a major armed conflict in the Pacific in my lifetime. I felt that, given that there's a limited number of people who understand China and particularly also understand those kinds of issues and topics, I had a responsibility that if I could do good work in an area, even if I'm just a tiny cog in a giant system, if I could do some constructive work to try to prevent a major war in the Pacific or small thing is becoming big problems, I should do that work. And so the crisis group advisor position was an opportunity to do that. For all of us working in China at that time, if you understood China and you were aware of the arbitrariness of the system and the law, you always lived with a certain perennial fear that something you wrote or said or did or that your government did might be misperceived somehow and you hoped you might at least be able to get off lightly, maybe with getting berated by the MFA or something rather than actually having the men in black come and drag you away. It's definitely not espionage, it's diplomatic reporting, pure and simple. I think the issue is that the Chinese have a selective definition of espionage and if you look at their current 2023 counter-espionage law, they've essentially criminalized asking nosy questions. Some of the main issues I was looking at were things like the South China Sea disputes, tensions between China and Taiwan. The main thing that I was actually drawn into working on was not in fact China, but rather North Korea, because at that point in time, over the last couple of years, Kim Jong-un had been ramping up North Korea's missile testing and including nuclear testing and was being increasingly menacing. He liked to live there because it was a good place to run his tour business and he didn't speak Chinese. The point being that my initial interest in him was simply like, oh, we have a Canadian living in a part of the country that is probably not the safest place to be doing business. Let's keep tabs and keep in touch with him and make sure he's doing okay. Some of Canada's allies say China could use Huawei's technology to spy on the Canadian government even spy on us. Last week, the Pentagon banned sales of Huawei phones on American military bases around the world. And FBI director Christopher Ray had this to say. We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values and provides. The officials at lawmakers are concerned about Chinese companies in the US telecom sector. Huawei said in a statement that the US market presents unique challenges and it remains committed to the effort. Huawei said that privacy and security are always its first priorities. Huawei's CFO has been arrested in Canada at the request of US authorities Canadian officials say she was arrested on Saturday, the same day as China and the US, signed a temporary trade war truce. At the time I did assess that there would be consequences because the Chinese tend to like retaliation in such cases. I didn't expect that they would take hostages and I didn't expect they would take me a hostage in particular. First of all because the source of the dispute was really with the United States. I actually speculated that would they for example detain an American tech executive or something and thought well that wouldn't make sense that's just going to chill the business community on China. So unfortunately I thought through some of that but I underestimated I think their rationalness and ruthlessness in prosecuting their things. And also I think I didn't entirely think through adequately what China's objectives were in taking hostages there. I was in Hong Kong at the time but I had a ticket to Beijing in a few days. So again if you want to talk about sort of how human mind works right we tend to keep going with the default of what we're doing unless something pushes us to change it. I think if I hadn't had a ticket booked I might have waited. I mentioned idealism and practicality both are important in our day at Huawei. We look up at the stats and look into the future. We also keep our feet only ground and do what we can with what is possible today. US prosecutors say Meng used a shell company for Huawei's dealings with Iran, misleading banks into approving millions of dollars in transactions that violated sanctions. The Chinese side has lodged stern representations and made clear our solemn position to the Canadian and the US sides respectively on this matter. We demand that they immediately clarify the reason for the detention and release the detainee and earnestly protect the legal and legitimate rights and interests of the person involved. I actually did an interview with Al Jazeera about the Meng case on the 5th or 6th of December just after the news broke. So I was also like many analysts scrambling to try to understand what happened and what the implications were. Trying to get information from the Canadian government about how serious is this? What are the Chinese saying to you? But nobody in the Canadian government would talk to me about it. So it was a bit frustrating that way. So I had grocery bags in my hands. And we walked back through the underground passage, came up a spiral staircase onto the plaza. And I've always wondered what would have happened if I had instead walked across the main plaza rather than coming up from below. And if I had seen the fact that there were over a dozen men in black standing outside the entrance of my apartment building there. But as it was, we popped out of this spiral staircase and there they were immediately surrounding us. These men in black with cameras on their uniforms, but no markings. A woman holds up a piece of paper with Chinese writing on it that I didn't have a chance to read because everything was happening too quickly, but apparently was a warrant for my arrest. I pulled up, I could see obviously this was not a very good situation. Pulled up my phone trying to call maybe the Canadian embassy, call anybody who was going to quickly answer to let them know that I was in a situation. They grabbed my arms, they pulled the phone away from me. They dragged my partner who was pregnant at the time away from me. So that was one of my primary concerns. Hey, what are you doing? They effectively immobilized me and then forced me to walk towards a waiting set of black SUVs. And when you're in a situation like that, you immediately think it's a fight or flight instinct kicking in. There were far too many of them to even consider somehow fighting or scuffling with them. And I was also immediately mindful of the fact that really you want to get into a fight with security officers, even if you're completely innocent, you're going to be in even deeper trouble after that. So there wasn't much other option but complying with them. So they drove off into the night. I couldn't see where we were going, but I could kind of peek around the blindfold a little bit to see the clock on the dashboard. And so I got to keep track of time. I counted the minutes and tried to figure out where the car was turning. And based on that, I was able to reckon that we headed into South Beijing. Although I couldn't be sure because you go on these loops. We headed down the third ring road and ended up at 45 minutes later into South Beijing. Here the gate opening. I hear a lot of dogs barking, crunch of gravel. And then I feel that we've gone down into an underground parking garage. They took me upstairs up an elevator from there and sat me in an office and took off the blindfold. And they had sat me in one of the standard interrogation chairs. It almost sort of looked feels like an adult version of a child's high chair. And it's that disempowering as well. They just simply fold a board of a sort of tray over your legs and then lock it into place so that you can't get out of the chair. And the sitting at the desk was an older Chinese man, maybe in his late 50s or early 60s, very thick glasses, a translator or an interpreter standing next to him and a couple of the uniformed officers there. But no badges or identifying marks. I was still hoping that maybe this was just their very aggressive way of inviting me to drink tea. Many correspondence, maybe now you personally will have been brought in at some point by the security services to have conversations about things. And my hope was this was just their way of inviting me to a conversation. But then they told me that night that you've been detained for questioning on suspicion of endangering China's national security. And at that point I knew that my worst case scenario was unfolding. The Economist. The Economist. The Economist. Story breaking right now out of China. There's now a report that a Canadian is being detained in China. We're talking about a former diplomat for this country. We have a picture of him for you right here. His name is Michael Cobraig. Now he no longer works for us. My hope was this was just there where inviting me to a conversation. But then they told me that night that you've been detained for questioning on suspicion of endangering China's national security. And at that point I knew that my worst case scenario was unfolding. Now we don't know if this is in response to the detection of the month on these extra dishes and charges again we're working for confirmation here. But this certainly is the kind of reprisals that some have feared what happened. Hong is a very influential woman in the people's republic. China warned of serious consequences what form those consequences take. We do not yet know and we don't know why. Michael Cobraig has been detained for the statement from the first few days. I was aware of Mengwan Zhou and as a Canadian it did cross my mind at that time that those two things might not be unconnected. But of course the interrogators that I talked to would never acknowledge that their narrative was always that I had done something wrong and they were there to figure out what it was that I had done wrong. I felt that by not playing along by speaking my truth into their system, it's almost sort of like introducing a virus into a computer, right? Michael Cobraig had been taken to Dahongmen, the Beijing State Security Detention Center It was so late and I was so tired I decided if I started ruminating on the situation, then I could be up all night. So I somehow managed out of sheer exhaustion to go to sleep. They left the lights on from that time until 2021 when I finally went home. The lights were never off. Beijing is now holding two Canadians, apparently doubling the reprisals for Canada's arrest of a rich and powerful Chinese executive and multiplying the concerns for Ottawa this morning in this deepening diplomatic dispute. For Canada's wrongful detention of Miss Mengwan Zhou, we have made clear our position, as for the cases of these two Canadian citizens, like I said, relevant authorities, China's state security authorities, are acting in accordance with laws and regulations. a small cell. The Covrig was in solitary. Covrig recalled the boasts, So up to nine hours, sometimes they'll wake you up in the middle of the night to disorient you and do another round of interrogation, and that just happens, you know, nightmare groundhog day. They had three goals, essentially. First, get them to confess. So it's essentially an exercise in gas-living, and by which I really mean constructing a reality in which you are the bad person who has done wrong things. China is good and noble, and you have wronged the people of China, and only when you come to realize that, and you repent and apologize and confess to crimes, and throw yourself on their mercy and beg for forgiveness, then maybe they might speak to the prosecutor and suggest that you could get a lighter sentence. Secondly, in my case, they were interested in who I had talked to in China. The lead interrogator said it to me at one point. We want to plug the leaks. They were trying to get me to disclose information about the Canadian government and its allies. So I very quickly had to engage in a kind of mental triage, because I had been a diplomat with top secret clearance for many years. So initially I just didn't cooperate at all. I just kept saying, look, this is outrageous. I haven't done anything wrong. You have no right to do this. It's a standard sort of billy as procedural that I need to speak to a lawyer. And I use this sort of legal defense every time they tried to get me to admit to a crime, where I said it would always also say, look, I'm not an expert in Chinese law. I can't agree with you that you say that's a crime. For the first month I essentially didn't cooperate so they didn't feed me. And they threatened me with never seeing my family again, never seeing daylight, possible life sentence, possible execution. They made it very clear that basically they were accusing me of espionage and threatened that it could carry a sentence of up to life or death. But if I cooperated with them, then I might be able to get that reduced down to 10 years if I were incredibly lucky five. It's just exceedingly confining. You're locked into that chair for hours on end. It's not torture in the sense of anybody is allowed to hit you, but it becomes excruciatingly uncomfortable and they're very strict with you. They won't even let you cross your legs that's considered disrespectful. They won't let you shift position. When they're interrogating you, you're almost just so relieved that another human is paying any attention to you and talking to you that you're desperate to talk and that's part of the whole point. They cut my rations to essentially a bowl of rice gruel and maybe a little bit of broth at each meal or a couple of sit mantos steamed buns. That was it. What was that doing to your health? I lost about 10 kilos in a month. That's a short answer. At that point, I was psychologically living day to day. I was like, I think I can get through tomorrow. To have that sink in made me essentially recognize that I needed a new strategy for dealing with interrogation. Welcome to Dunbar. It's a quiet residential neighborhood in Vancouver. A grey two story home stands out here. It belongs to Mengwan Zhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei. This is where she has been living since December. The home is a $5 million 3000 square foot, 6 bedroom jail cell. It's been referred to as the Guilded Cage. So I think anxiety probably runs in my family. So I'm really naturally the furthest thing from some kind of tranquil and master. But very early on, I decided that the only way I was going to survive this was if I had kind of iron discipline of myself. The entire environment is kind of pressing in on you in this little cell. So I began daily meditation when I was sitting in the cell. I recognized that immobility was going to be really crippling. And so when I wasn't being interrogated most of the time, I was moving around somehow, just pacing in circles, meditating or thinking about things. And I started doing body weight exercises and yoga. I started building a routine from the first week that by day one thousand was quite detailed. And I think that together with the meditation was crucial for survival. And it also sent a signal to them, right? If they interrogate me for three hours, they go at me and then they send me back to myself. And the first thing that I do is drop into 50 push-ups and crunches and then start planking and sending message to them. So I started fairly early on having a kind of gratitude prayer that I would start the day with. Things that may seem kind of new agey or silly in a day-to-day situation, but which are existential essential when you're hanging on to your sanity and life by your fingernails. Well, breathing stuff. But what it makes you realize is these are serious techniques, box breathing, for example, other things to sort of try to manage your own parasympathetic nervous system. Navy SEALs use box breathing techniques. These are not sort of, you know, hippy, hippy things to do. I also would come up with a bunch of mantras, essentially. Being exotic, just sort of repetitive phrases and so on. I literally sort of focused on alliteration. So it would be things like, you know, I would sort of think of like ten words that started with S that would make you feel somehow sort of instill a sort of sense of determination. You so like... That's just a little hard to bring back emotionally. Driven, determined, dedicated, disciplined. It's usually sort of basically trying to remind yourself how to be, things like that. I built a memory palace for myself of my own life. I basically took a very long walk, starting with my earliest memories all the way to the present day, partly trying to make sense in some... Because when you're in a situation like that, the other thing you're thinking of is, where did I go wrong? What choices did I make in my life that led me to being in a cell in an unknown location in Beijing? How did I mess up that badly? That's a bad way to think about it, but invariably you're to almost try to contextualize it. So I went through every moment that I could remember in my life in order, and that took many, many days. They brought me into the interrogation room for what I thought was going to be another, stealing myself for another morning round of interrogations, and the interrogator sitting at the desk, and instead of his usual, always very intimidating stack of vials, they would always bring these big, fat stacks of papers and rifling through them, basically... In a classic, almost soviet way, on that day he had a single piece of paper from which he read from in a monotone voice. Four days ago, your partner gave birth to a baby girl. Mother and daughter are healthy. That's all I have for you today. He gets up and walks out and leaves me sitting in the chair for the rest of the morning, locked into it, reflecting on the fact that... I have a daughter now, and I can't see her and I wasn't there when she was born. When we in the West wonder, well, if the Communist Party state is so repressive and harsh and increasingly authoritarian, why don't the people rise up against it? I mean, there is very much a high degree of powerlessness, of even the people who are the operators of that very system. They feel like cogs in a machine, and the best they can do, in most cases, is to try to protect themselves and their families, maybe try to enrich themselves on the side if they can, but just go along to get along. And for them, it was very hard to accept that the system that they had served loyally and devotedly, they thought all their lives. And most of these people were in their mid to late fifties, or older. That that system had now thrown them in the garbage with no recourse, and now was treating them so badly from their perspective. You could look up and see the sky. That was it. Yes, you could look out and you could see the sky. That was very beautiful to see. And sometimes you would have a sunbeam coming through the window, and we would take turns sitting in this beam of sunshine. Huawei is Chinese. So late January or early February 2020, the Gmorden and his team walked into our cell wearing those big white hazmat suits, complete with goggled gloves and boots. And we're all, my cellmates and I are all looking at each other like, the heck is this? And it led to us being even more isolated and locked down and sealed up. And that was a period for eight months when I had absolutely no contact with the outside world at all. It was like being in a space capsule and Houston control is not answering. I read a lot of philosophy, particularly Stoic and Buddhist philosophy. I found those both the most helpful for me. And it reminds you, perennially, that there are things that are in your control and there are things that are not. But if you focus on your own sphere of control, then you can at least achieve some self-mastery. What really matters at the end of the day is not all these material things or your physical conditions. What matters is wisdom. What matters is virtue and honor and moral integrity. I gave a long statement in which I made it one equivocally clear that I thought I was innocent and that I was a political hostage, that I was there because of Mengwan Joe's detention in Canada, and that if the judges had even the slightest bit of independence and sense of justice, they would see the obvious things before them and determine that I was innocent and release me. I had no expectation that they would actually do that, of course, but I wanted to put it on the record. That kind of Marxist-Leninist system insists on this sort of performative contrition and repentance, and only then can you be redeemed when you throw yourself in the party's mercy. And I felt that by not playing along, by speaking my truth into their system, it's almost sort of like introducing a virus into a computer, right? But ultimately, I'm not the hostage in that moment. I'm the only man who is master of himself, the only man who is speaking freely. Everyone else is following the system's script. band, bankrupt. I'd rather not go into it, but let's just say they weren't friendly about it. I did. And tarmac has never tasted better, kind of minerally. Yeah. Welcome home. A reunion 1,020 days in the making. Michael Covric and Michael Spavall are now home. The two Canadians embrace by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after touching down in Spavall's hometown of Calgary. That if he held some view that I was in any way complicit in what happened to him, he had 100 opportunities to express that and never did. There's no such thing as being completely safe from that system and what I would hope that this entire story illustrates is that that is fundamentally not a rule of law system. The Communist Party uses the law as a political tool and weapon. It will adhere to international treaties and agreements when they suit it and ignore them when they don't and subvert them when that suits its purposes or even try to write and revise new ones. In the case of my own detention, they violated my human rights on various counts. They violated the international convention against torture because the treatment they subjected me to is unquestionably psychological torture. They violated the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Canada-China Consular Treaty and a number of other agreements. If they wouldn't honor those agreements before, why would they honor their own laws and things now? The bottom line of that is that I hope that things will be fine now, but I live in a world where one can never make that assumption and that is not just with respect to me. This is a hybrid challenge that all countries that value their own sovereign independent decision-making need to understand much more clearly. One of the reasons why I wouldn't go along with the false Chinese narrative that they kept trying to construct around us was that ultimately when you start making that kind of compromise, it's a slippery slope. So you need to have a very clear understanding when interacting with anyone from that system, what your values are, what your principles are, but also what your interests are, either as an organization or as a country, and you need to be ready to firmly defend those and push back when necessary. The whole point of the post-World War II international order, what we call the liberal rules-based international order, as imperfect as it has been, as flawed, as sometimes hypocritical. But that is fundamentally vastly more benign world than the kind of world that China would drag us into if it were to become the dominant or even a predominant state in shaping world order. That would be a much darker world that would be shaped much more by China's preferences. And do you really want your children to grow up in that world if we can avoid it? And so we've all got to start growing in the same direction. So it seems to me a basic litmus test for any decision is, is this going to undermine the liberal rules-based international order? Is it going to empower what are ultimately hostile, not friendly organizations? And if it is, maybe you shouldn't be doing it. My number one responsibility is to be the best person I can be for my family, the best father I can for my daughter, the best partner for my loved ones. Open AI's latest investment round has apparently ballooned to a new high valuation as well as a significant $250 million minimum investment. I think about the election is that so many planets are retrograde right after it like Mars we're going to have a mercury retrograde Jupiter's retrograde like it's just like so much going on. What does that mean? What I think it means is mass confusion. So how I'm doing this is in the middle ring the first kind of ring here this is a chart and I can put someone's birth chart here so like as an example this is Trump's chart. Astro.com. They have all like any political figure public person. They have all of the information. Trump, he's got major things happening. He's going to enter the peak of his life in April 25th. So if she does win, I do think she might carry out two terms. Kamala Harris, does she have a chance of winning the presidential election based on her astrology? Let's get into it. If you have your sun, moon or rising in cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio or Sagittarius, then this is what's coming for you. I just talked about how Trump would go through a very volatile event. July 15th and July 13th was the actual assassination attempt. I pretty put that Joe Biden would drop out on July 23rd and he dropped out on the 21st. And I predicted the end of the Hollywood writer's strike last year. By all in one readings which combine the birth chart and the transes and the secondary progressions, which is another timing technique, that is 750 for an hour. So this is kind of when things get wild and then things get really insane once we get into July of 25. In what way? What do you see there? Mass division amongst people, fighting, conflict, independence, wanting to break free. The Economist Consider this. There are two football teams on a pitch, 22 players in total. One of the chances that two of those players share a birthday. How about this one? If I shuffle a pack of cards, what's the probability that the cards have all been arranged in exactly the same order before in the entire history of the earth? Well, at least since the invention of playing cards. Our guest today will explain how the counterintuitive answers to riddles like these lie in an area of maths statistics which has profound impacts on everything from how governments manage their economies to how scientists discover new knowledge. And the same maths can help us all better understand and manage the chance, the risk and the luck involved in modern life. If you're going to make decisions in positions of risk, some idea of probability or chance of something happening is important, but also then what the consequences are if it happens because something could have terrible consequences, and if the risk is negligible, you're not going to worry about it too much. And on the other hand, if something doesn't matter, you don't care what the probability is if it happens. So David Spiegelhalter is a professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge. He's also a prolific communicator of statistical ideas. Listeners in Britain might remember him from his work helping the public make sense of the deluge of data during the COVID-19 pandemic. So David's new book, The Art of Uncertainty, explains why statistics isn't just for mathematicians, economists and scientists. As an individual when you're making a decision about a medical treatment, there's no formula that's going to tell you what to do. That would be ridiculous, but you can have a really good description with the uncertainties of what might be the consequences and make an informed decision. I'm Alok Jar and this is Babbage from the Economist. Today, how to thrive in an uncertain world. So David, thank you for joining me on Babbage. It's a great pleasure. David, the last time you came on the show, it was to talk about COVID-19. A lot of people in Britain will remember seeing you on TV screens during that period. It was a time when everyone was learning in real time how to think about statistics and numbers. Now you've communicated a lot of complex stats in your time. What's the most effective piece of statistical communication that you've ever seen? And what impact do you think you had? OK, I'm not sure about the one I've ever seen. Can I talk about the one I think we did, which was very effective? Go for it. Well, in April 2021, the AstraZeneca vaccine was first linked up with these nasty blood clots, which seemed to be happened particularly in young people. And we produced some graphics showing at the current level of how much COVID there was about what this meant in terms of the possible benefits of vaccination. And we chose avoiding admission to intensive care, not death because we're going to something roughly parallel to the blood clots. And just for context, this was about the AstraZeneca vaccine, which would be giving to lots and lots of people around the world. It was a very good vaccine. And there was a tiny, tiny correlation with some people getting there was alerts coming in from Scandinavia and other countries about some patients getting these nasty blood clots. And using British data, we then analyzed the data, fitted a regression model and found out the risk did increase as you got younger, which is very surprising. Yeah, exactly. So if you look at the benefits of vaccine in 20 to 30, 30, 30 to 40, 40 to 50, the benefits compared with the age group I was in at the time was 60 to 69. They're really big benefits, but they drop exponentially as you get younger. So the benefits are incredibly small from vaccination when you're in your 20s. Just explain that slightly. Why are the benefits so small? Because the chance of, if you get COVID, it was generally very mild indeed. And very few were going to be admitted to intensive care anyway. So even if that risk was reduced by 78% or something like that, it's actually in terms of absolute risk and absolute benefit. It was very small. So it's a difference between this and a relative benefit was quite large because the chance of being admitted went down for everybody, but the absolute benefit went right down for people who are at low risk anyway. Okay. So this is the interesting thing when you're looking at whether a vaccine is approved or not, they only look at relative benefits. They just say, well, this has got a 90% reduction in the risk of death if you catch COVID. And that is the basis on which it's approved. However, if you're looking at whether to take the vaccine, you have to look at the absolute benefits. In other words, out of the 100,000 people or so, how many people will benefit and how many people will be harmed. And when you look to the number that would be harmed, which went up as you got younger, by the time you got into the 20s, the harms actually started to outweigh the benefit. This is for the AstraZeneca vaccine. For the AstraZeneca vaccine. And so we produced this graphic, which I think was rather good. And I talked to Jonathan Van Tam in the morning and explained it. And he said, this is great. We loved it. Jonathan Van Tam was the deputy teacher, medical advisor of Britain at the time, and regularly on TV explaining the stats, the numbers, explaining how the pandemic was going essentially. Yeah, exactly. And then we were sat and watched him on television the afternoon. I thought he was just going to explain it, but he used our graphic and went through it in great detail. And I think it's probably the most complex graphic that's ever been put up in front of a mainstream audience. But because he's extremely trustworthy, he really understood it. There were no politicians on the stage, and he could take his time and treat the audience with respect as intelligent adults. And he did all that and then said, and so we're saying unless there's no alternative, the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be given to people under 30. And it was later raised under 40. And everyone nodded their head and said, fine, no accusations of you turns, no big fuss in the newspapers the next day. Our graphic was copied by everybody around the world. I'm really proud of it. I think people who have not seen that graphic should Google it because it is a very famous statistical diagram, probably the most famous after the bell curve. Essentially, well, let's step back a bit. Your book isn't about uncertainty, right? And before we go into how that helps you understand the world, just do fine for me what a statistician means by uncertainty. Yeah, that's quite true. I mean, I had to start the book with that. What? For me, I mean, for the vernacular, I said, he means we just don't know something exactly. It means doubt. Exactly. That's wrong. Exactly. So I use, it's not being certain. It's the conscious awareness of ignorance. It's when you just don't know. There's a good thing, actually. Oh, God, yes. Oh, no, no, I pump uncertainty. Yes. I pump it up and say, you know, you've got to be uncertain. And people are uncertain. It's a part of being human. And people want to be uncertain. Okay, let me test you. Do you want to know what you're going to get for Christmas? I don't. When you've recorded a football match, do you want to know the result? No, I'm definitely not. Do you, when you're watching, you know, a thriller on, you know, don't want to look at the last episode. No, no, no, no. Okay, let's do a more tricky one. When you go on holiday, do you meticulously plan everything or do you just book the flight and just take off? I'm somewhere in the middle. Somewhere in the middle. I like to make sure that the main elements are booked. Right. And then I'm willing to sort of improvise for three hours. Okay, sort of in the middle. Yeah, okay. Because I've had to change. I used to be meticulous planning. And now we go on holiday. I'm only booked the first night. So, anyway, finally, if I could tell you when you were going to die, would you want to know? How certain would you be that you need that? Oh, no, I can't tell you. It's pretend I'm this all-knowing being. Pretend you're God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I don't want to you wouldn't want to know. Some people do. Some people would. Yeah, the point is that I mean, what I'm just playing around with is that we live with uncertainty all the time. And actually, we relish it. It's fine. It's fine. Except some people find it more difficult to deal with than others. And there's a clinical condition of intolerance of uncertainty that there's a scale for. You can test yourself on. It makes people incredibly not too risk of us, but they would need to know everything that's going to happen to them in the future. But generally, uncertainty is when we don't know. And in the book, I make clear, we often think about uncertainty about the future, but a fact, a lot of the time we're uncertain about the past, what actually happened, what caused what, what actually went on. And we can be really uncertain about what's going on at the moment. And COVID demonstrated that brilliant. We just didn't know how many people were catching it. We didn't know how many people were dying of it. And we didn't know in the past how many people died from it. So those sorts of known as epistemic uncertainty, the uncertainty of not knowing is incredibly important. So when people refer to things as being likely or unlikely, what does that mean? And what are the problems that can arise from using language to do the same thing? Oh, massive problems. And I use as an example, the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, which had been planned by the CIA for Cuban exiles, which I toppled the Castro Revolutionary Government. And in Kennedy, found out about that. And he asked for a report on it from military intelligence authorities. And in the original report, it would be assessed a 30% chance of it working. In other words, a 70% chance it wouldn't work. But this was conveyed to it. And the numbers were taken out in the version he saw and it was described as a fair chance. Right. By which the author. Well, the author's meant not too good. But that was not how it was interpreted. And they went ahead with it. And it was a fiasco. And in the post mortem, one of the generals said, well, you know, why didn't someone just say, this is a really bad idea. You know, this has got us only a small chance of working. And so there's this group think that took over. And since then, intelligence agencies have really pioneered the idea of not just using words. So for example, in the UK, if you're talking in an intelligence agency and use the word likely, you mean between 55 and 75% probability. And so everyone can refer back to that all the time. It's the probability yardstick. And other people are using these ideas now. And in the book, I give about eight different definitions of likely that different agencies use. And they're all around about 50 to 70%, 80% maybe else in the end. And these are necessarily very rough. But that's fine. Because all you want to do is convey. It puts everyone's same frame. Everyone's same frame. It stops these really real misunderstandings. And so you can actually distinguish between different opinions. The other story I use is when President Obama was considering the Seals mission too. Well, I turned out to assassinate a summer bin Laden and trying to say whether he was in that compound in a butt of ad or not. He had different teams. And this is the other brilliant thing. He didn't just have one group looking at this. He's different groups, including a red team who's deliberately taking quite a pessimistic view. And so they all came up with their own probabilities that he is there, which varied, say from, I think, from 30% to 80%. And he heard all these at different opinions. And he teams are independent. Yeah. Yeah. And I believe they didn't speak to each other. These independent rules, which the brilliant thing to do, really good. And then he had to make the judgment quite right. It's political judgment. He and the end he said he thought is about 5050 and went ahead with it. And it was successful. But if he had only heard just one of those opinions, it could have been very passing. And that I think is something I push in the book is a real example of the importance of having a diversity of viewpoints. I think that giving a composite number to the president to that point would not have been useful because in that average hides lots of problems. Some people have it over the whole paper's been written about how he should have been given a composite number. And I would say definitely not because if you're a decision maker, you want to know the difference in agreement between your different groups of people, your experts, you want that disagreement as part of the uncertainty that you should be presented with. Yeah. It can be quite hard to quantify uncertainty or confidence in decisions. So I wanted to try something out in practice if you didn't mind. I know you use a quiz to help with this. Just explain what it is and let's try it out. Oh yeah, I'd love to. In the book I've described it, do you know what you don't know? So it's putting a level of confidence on a claim which measures your uncertainty, your ignorance. And so I ask you a question with two possible answers A or B. And you kind of have to say, do you prefer A or B and then say how confident you are in the conclusion on a scale from five to ten. So if you're absolutely certain, you say ten out of ten A, if you haven't got a clue, say five out of ten A. And if you kind of think it might be, you might say seven out of ten for your answer. And then you know, the art true answer is revealed and then you get scored. And it uses a special scoring rule that's been designed to really encourage honesty. And it can sound quite a brutal scoring rule for us. So if you say ten out of ten and you're right, you score 25 points. But if you say ten out of ten and you're wrong, you lose 75. Okay. So it's really asymmetric. It punishes but errors more than correct. But the scoring happens afterwards. You're not told first, I'll ask you the question for it. Okay, go for it. Okay, so first question in the book, which is higher? A, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, B, the Empire State Building in New York. Okay, I think the Empire State Building, how confident am I? Probably about a six. Oh really, not quite sure. Not quite sure? Yeah, good, good, good. Okay, who is older? The Prince of Wales, William or the Princess of Wales, Kate. I think the Prince of Wales. And I'm very confident I would say probably ten for that. Three, which is larger? A, Croatia, B, the Czech Republic. I think Croatia. But I'm not that confident. Probably seven. So I've answered really questions, David. And I think the producers have tallyed up the score. Right. There's ten questions. Ten questions. That's my score over there. Yeah. You tell the listeners how good or bad I am. Well, you're worse than a chimpanzee. So when people have said that to me, if you had just said five for everything, just press the line up. That would have been the safe button. The safe button. Just said five or just press that button. You would have scored zero, state where you are. Well, the thing is that I like to be exciting. Right. And you scored minus 179. Is that good? That's not good, is it? It's not good. It's not good. And you got off to a really bad start by being ten out of ten confident, the Prince of Wales, with the older. When he wasn't, Kate's older, six months older, William. Oh, there you go. That was last. You lost 75 points immediately by being over confident. But the rest of them are fairly bad. You're not bad. On the shows. On the rest of them, you're not doing too badly. That was the one that hit you. And the rest you stayed around chimpanzee level. So that was not bad at all. So the point about these quizzes, which can seem a bit silly, they are really serious. And they're used to train analysts and predictors, super forecasters, and so on, to stop them being over confident, to stop them doing what you did for the Prince of Wales. Is it possible for me to become a better sort of person then? Was it, am I lost? No, no, because these are users' training exercises. And I use these for teaching school kids and so on, to be honest about your ignorance. And so very low negative scores, after say it does tend to be a male trade. And people who score a lot, you know, are people who know a lot. And people who stay around zero are people who know they don't know too much, and are very cautious, putting sixes and things like that. People who get big negative scores think they know stuff and don't. So I think that that's what I've come across as. But I will tell you, my personality is one of being very ignorant about things and being very conscious of my ignorance. Yeah, yeah, no, there's only one question that rest of you to stay around zero for the rest of the questions, is really pretty good performance. Most people score negative points and quite a lot. Okay, so I guess if we apply this way of thinking about the world to forecasting questions, or uncertainties, who's going to be the next US president at all? How likely is it that a new drug will work in a clinical trial? How do we then elicit useful probabilists? Both of those are used all the time. I mean, the president one would be, for example, in betting exchanges, you're looking at that stuff all the time. But how likely is this drug to work in a clinical trial is now increasingly used within the pharmaceutical industry. People's judgments about how effective a new drug might be are terribly important to work out. Well, is this worth pursuing to plan a drug development program? I've spent a lot of time eliciting such subjective probabilities about the benefits of a new treatment from senior doctors. We did it when we're planning cancer clinical trials and they really weren't bad at it. And so there are processes, I mean, if I was trying to elicit a probability from you, I wouldn't just ask a simple question because there's no true probability sitting in your head. How I elicit it, I construct it on the basis of how I ask the questions. So I'd ask them in lots of different ways and approach it from different angles and so on in order to get a fairly robust conclusion. So for example, if I really was asking seriously about whether William was older than Kate, I really would say, are you absolutely sure I'd push you to, you know, about are you being overconfident and so on to try to drag you into perhaps a more realistic state? And these are really important ideas. So, you know, people have heard of super forecasters and the scoring role I'm using is exactly the one, you know, in a slightly different version that's used for super forecasting competitions. Because in these competitions, nobody says what's going to happen. They give probabilities for what's going to happen. And that scoring rule is known as the Brier Scoring Rule is actually developed for weather forecasting in 1951. It's the Brier as a meteorologist, but it's enormously effective at training people to give honest judgments that are not too confident and are calibrated in the sense that when someone says I'm 70% sure, if of the times they say that, the right 70% of the time. And similarly in weather forecasts, when, you know, you read something, I was a 10% chance of rain, of the times it says that it should rain 10% of the time. These are known as calibrated, reliable forecasts. And you need training to do that as an individual. So these super forecasting competitions have used these rules and found out characteristics of people who are good at them. Would you be good at them? I don't think on that score, I've just got, I wouldn't be good at them at all, would I? But for the other bits, you might be because you're cautious. You're not too gung-home. No, it was just the one, wasn't it? That's what I need to learn about myself. So I just not get too over excited about what one answer basically. I guess something that's underlying all of these things is people's perception. How do people generally perceive risks themselves based on what they know already? And what I want to talk about here is Bayesian statistics. Why Bayesian statistics is possibly one of the most important concepts in statistics itself, but also how humans perceive the world? I would call myself a Bayesian statistician, and I've done that for 50 years. So the basic idea is that instead of data coming along and looking at the data and from that you get an estimate of an answer, data is seen as something that revises an initial belief. And so is to do with updating your beliefs on the basis of new evidence and how mathematically those beliefs should change. And Bayes was quite interesting because when he came to describing probability, it was all to do with betting. You know, odds you should be prepared to accept in order to make a gamble. Okay, so give me an example of a Bayesian way of looking at something and why it's better than a more traditional way. Well, I suppose the example I give in the book is automatic facial recognition systems. And when you read about those, you just hear about their, what's called their sensitivity, how many of people on a watch list they might pick up in a crowd, or you know, what's the chance of finding somebody if they really are in the crowd. And their specificity is, in other words, how many false positives there are out of people who are not on the watch list, how many people will be picked up by the facial recognition system. And that sounds fine, but actually it doesn't tell you how the system will operate in practice. What you need to know is how many people are actually in the crowd who are on the watch list, you know, suspicious people are actually in the crowd. The classical idea is, what's the probability that somebody is detected given there on the watch list? What you really want to know is the other way round, what's the probability that they're on the watch list given they've been detected? The system's gone ping. And that's Bayes theorem. It had to switch those two things. And those can be completely different so that the system can sound very accurate and yet most of the findings are false positives. So what you're trying to say is that in a facial recognition system, if it's looking at a crowd and it comes up with this person is a person of interest. Bayes theorem gives you a sort of framework for understanding how much you should believe. Yeah, I like you as it to be right. And for the characteristics of the system that were published at the time of the King's coronation, for example, it would suggest that most of the positives coming out were false positives. Weren't we through an example of the facial recognition system with some numbers? Okay, the crucial way to approach all these problems is saying what does it mean for 100 people or a thousand people? Or in my case, I'm looking at a crowd of 10,000, for example, of the coronation. Let's say there were 10 people of interest somewhere in that crowd. So there's one in a thousand. We're actually of interest. So the system is claimed to detect 70% of people on the watch list if they're there. And so it would go ping for seven of them. However, out of the remaining 9,990 who are not on the watch list, it would identify about one and a thousand of those. These are false alerts. As a false alerts. And that's 10 people. So you've got seven true positives and 10 false positives. So the majority of people being identified were false positives. That's really important to know. It is important to know because of course they could be ruled out by further investigations. But if the people who are seeing this thing come up think that it's got 70% accuracy or 99.9% accuracy. They might definitely think all that really means this person is on the watch list. They claim that now the actuallys have got better. But there still is this problem in all screening systems that there can be many false positives coming up. And it's not intuitive. And just to underline the point, where does basis theorem actually help you understand the problems with the facial recognition system? Okay. What it's saying is that the evidence from the facial recognition system should just change your belief that a particularly individual is on the watch list. You start off in looking at the whole crowd. You think there's 10 people there. I think well, everyone's just got a one in a thousand probability of being on the watch list. They go ping when the camera fixes on them. And that changes using base theorem and it actually goes up to about 40%. So it's much higher, of course. And you know, worth investigating. But it doesn't shoot up. So the crucial thing is that what bassroom does is tell you how to revise your beliefs after receiving more evidence. And obviously then you go on to look at more evidence. Now, as theorem has also become important for machine learning and modern AI as well, because these are, if anyone's been listening to our podcast, at least in the last few months, statistical probabilistic things. And they use base theorem to actually operate. Some do. I used to work on uncertainty at AI 40 years ago. That's when I started working on it. And the uncertainty in AI conferences, the first one was in 1986. And I was contributing to all those ideas. And back then, the sort of AI systems, people call them expert systems, that were, a lot of them were based on what we call Bayesian networks. We really were, they're much smaller. And they propagated uncertainty using probability theory through them. And I worked on that a lot and developed algorithms for it. Now, since then, with the development of large language models, he's a enormous recurrent neural networks. He's deep learning. A vast numbers of parameters, billions of parameters. And they propagate evidence through that enormous network structure. But I don't believe that would generally be by a formal base theorem. So that means that when they come out and make claims, they can't put a probability on those claims, which is what I wish they could. And so what they do is make a completely confident claim, and then put a little warning at the bottom saying, this may be wrong or this may have hallucinations. And the developers of these systems know that this is not really good enough. And there's a lot of interest in there in trying to develop some form of probability or confidence measures on the claims being made. And I think that's a wonderful area of research fascinating and very important indeed. Because otherwise, how do we know what to trust? Well, it kind of that idea, hearks back to what we were talking about earlier in your briar quiz, which is giving an answer, but also giving a confidence. That's useful for humans. So why not for AIs as well? I exactly. The idea you just make a claim, yes, no, it's like making a prediction. I don't want to know a prediction. I wasn't aware how confident somebody is. So I don't want someone just say, I think they're going to win the election. I want a probability on it. Because otherwise, you know, you don't really know, is this person just making this up? And not only do I want a probability, I want to know the basis for that probability. So you're getting down to another level, you know, how sure are you about that probability? Is it based on a fantastic amount of data and a really good model or have you just made it up? And I want to know the evidential basis for the probability claim that you're making. So you sort of going a level down. So David, you know, you're a professional statistician, but you know, you live life. How does your awareness of things like risk, probability, statistics, how does it change how you choose to live your life? Yeah, I think it has. I mean, I'm quite aware of, I won't get on a motorbike. Too dangerous. Yeah, I think it is. I don't want to take any of the risks. Even with helmets and yeah, yeah, yeah, I get nervous on this. But I'm also, I do try to be bold. I do try to take some risks, but without being reckless. So I will try, you know, quite physically demanding things. And I will try to expose myself to new experiences. But I buy insurance and I'm try to be careful to protect myself against the severe downsides as you might. Are you calculating risks all the time in your head as you walk around? Yeah, a little bit. Not too much. But I know I'm careful. And so, for example, you know, I try to eat well. I try to exercise both because I enjoy it. But I know that keeping fit, keeping a reasonable weight, are really important for my length of life. I'd quite like to live as long as I can. And so I do try to look after myself. What's your advice for others then? Is a way of maybe pulling them towards being able to quantifying risks around them? Oh, yeah. Well, I don't actually, I'm not this, you know, quantifiable self-stile. I don't, I haven't got a fit bit of any of this nonsense. No, no, no. I just, you know, got a vague idea on what is important and what isn't. You have to realise that there is a trade off in everything. And that sometimes the trade off is fun against possible loss, you know, possible risk or financial loss or something like that, but actually having fun is really important. So I think we've all got to make our trade offs. We've all got our own utility function, as the economists would say. And we have to take that into account. And so, you know, perhaps not to be too alarmed about every story that appears in the news about how dangerous something is. And actually, they remember it is watching a lecture by you. And you mentioned the idea of micro-mortes. No, micro-mortes. Which are basically a way to sort of put a number on things that happen to you. And then you can decide numerically whether something is worth doing or not. Yeah. Just explaining what that means. Micro-mort is a one-on-a-million chance of being killed or dying suddenly. And, you know, on average, we're all subject to 17,000 non-natural deaths each year in this country, which means that on average, we're all exposed to one micro-mort per day. That's our daily ration. There's some people who are a lot less because they're very cautious, some are a lot more, depending on how they live in their life. But it's a sort of good baseline is one a day. I use that as a sort of reference point. And then you can spend more. You know, I jumped out of a plane doing a tandem parachute. Yeah, if you were the one micro-mort. Which is about seven. It's about a week's worth. Yeah. I thought, oh, that's all right. I'll do that. And, you know, scuba diving has been five and ten running a marathon. It's about seven. So all these figures, there's some risk, but it's not out of the way. And then, of course, transport, you know, you can walk about 25 miles for a microphone. But you only get about seven miles on a motorbike from microphone, or as opposed to 250 miles in a car, about 7,000 in a train or a plane. So, you know, it gives you a way of just weighing up different things that might happen. But if I go in for a heart surgery or something like that, then you're spending thousands all at once. Well, it's a really interesting way of doing it. In my sort of non-scientific way, I can say that podcast interviewing is probably right down at the bottom. In terms of micro-mort, it's very safe activity. Well, apart from all the things that could fall in your head there. Yeah, exactly. So David, it's been a pleasure to talk to you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much indeed. In case you're burning to know the answers to those conundrums I posed at the start of the program, here they are. In more than half of all football games, two people on the pitch will share a birthday. And if you properly shuffle a deck of cards, it'll appear in an order that has never been seen ever in the history of the universe. Now you can read more details about these questions in Sir David's book. Thank you for listening. Babbage is produced by Kenar Patel and Jason Hoskin with mixing and sound design by Nico Rofast. The executive producers are Hannah Marinho and Chris Inbee. I'm Alok Jarr and in London, this is the Economist. The Economist I think an important place to start is you could see it coming. One, you could see A, the loss coming because of him just becoming a worse and worse candidate, a worse and worse president over time. And so the fact that he lost wasn't an overwhelming surprise to those, I think, honest on pliers. But then two, you could start to see the seeds of doubt being sown about different notions that the election was rigged and illegal people were voting and whatever the notion was. Never would have guessed the momentum would have taken off like it did. Within hours of the election, when I heard the lies starting to surface directly from Donald Trump's mouth and his top lieutenants, I called my chief of staff and said it's our turn to push back as quickly as we can. Because if we let this get out of the bag, I think it's going to be like a grass fire. And so I made those calls to the election boards. I made those calls to the Secretary of State's office to Gabe Sterling, his top election lieutenant and the attorney general and got no signs of any fraud. And that was a continuous process of asking them, was there anything new overnight? Was there anything of substance that came in? And so my initial energy was to stop in his tracks. Somebody was willing to lie and try to use Serp democracy because I didn't want to see what actually happened. Play out and unfortunately it did. What kind of pushback did you get from agreement with you? Yeah, it was a tale of two stories. Much like it is today, there was this on the surface, a unanimous Republican tone in tenor that Donald Trump was right. There must be fraud somewhere. We just haven't found it yet. But quietly behind the scenes with each passing day, whether it be officials that are elected in office or just Republicans in their political choices would quietly come to me and say, gosh, it is kind of surprising that there's no proof. Or that just seems unbelievable at this point. And thinking that fever would break for Donald Trump, once again, I was wrong. I take blame that I wasn't able to convince tens of millions of Republicans that Donald Trump was a liar and not worthy to be followed anywhere. I'll go in reverse order. I am very concerned that Donald Trump and the MAGA crowd will once again try to launch conspiracy theories into the universe if Donald Trump loses. Most certainly they will. They're continuing their efforts by trying to stack election boards, change petty laws, plant seeds of doubt on social media. All of those scenarios are unfortunately playing out in communities all over the country. With regard to fixing the problems from the last election, we did last election in 2020, post 2020 election, what we've done for 100 plus years with elections. And that is continue to update and modernize systems based on best practices, just like every country, every business, every city government does. And that's what we did. We found inefficiencies and things of that nature. Nothing that rose to even the remote stage of being a game changer for the 2020 election. We all know this. An overwhelming majority of individuals know this even if they're not willing to admit it. And so yes, we will continue in Georgia to have the fairest, safest, most legal elections probably in the entire country. We're the only state to have to put that on display for the entire world to see us four times in the post 2020 election with mechanical audits, hand audits, machine audits, every type of audit. And we pass the test with flying colors. want to make a point or do I want to make a difference? If I just show up to the polls and don't vote for Donald Trump and don't vote for anybody, I just simply make a point that I don't like Donald Trump and I don't endorse his behavior or his leadership or his whatever. But I truly want to make a difference. I've got to beat him. We've got to beat him as a nation. And so to do that, I want to cast my vote for first, I said Joe Biden, knowing that there was significant flaws with that endorsement, that I think that situation it's significantly improved when Kamala Harris came on board as a Democratic nominee. And I once again offered my endorsement and support because I think it truly gives us the best chance to make a difference. And I am a Republican. I will continue to be a Republican. And I've just one of those folks that have decided to look at this problem as like a restructuring process like a company, right? We have a failing company. It's called the Republican Party. And I'm willing to tear things down before we build things up. And it's painful. Restructuring and reorganizing is difficult. Many people listening have been a part of that in the corporate environment. That's what I'm looking to do in the Republican Party. And to do that, we have to fire Donald Trump today. A record number of Americans upwards of 67 million go to the polls to elect the 35th president As I look at the board here, while there are still some results still to come in, if the president continues, if Mr. Kennedy, Senator Kennedy will be the next president of the United States. The hours that followed were frustrating and baffling as the key returns hung in the ballot. The unexpectedly delayed time act saw Senator Kennedy the victor with a clear margin of President Eisenhower approved of the effort. I can say this that they both know about it. They both know I'm going to Chicago tomorrow and they know the purpose of my mission. They are not participating in this. They realize that it is my duty and responsibility to leave no stone unturned and exposing any irregularities, both of them believe in the sanctity of the American fella as do I. has received the president of the United States 300 and three votes, which had a Nixon of the greatest California as received two hundred and nineteen votes. The following January, as the sitting lost. This is the first time in 100 years that he can debate for the presidency and announced the result of an election in which he was defeated and announced the victory of his opponent. I do not think that we could have, in our striking and eloquent example, our the stability of our constitutional system and of the proud tradition of the American people, of developing and respecting and honoring institutions of South London. Well, the Democrats have two jobs. One is to win the election and the others to defend the election. So we have a rickety, decentralized, antiquated electoral infrastructure in process. So yeah, we've got to be concerned about every level of it. conduct a presidential election would be the way we have elections for governor or representative or anything else, wherever gets the most votes wins. We have a presidential election process that has independent certification processes in each state, the possibility of lawsuits being brought in each state. Think about what happened on January 6, 2021. He was ultimately a certification crisis because Trump and his forces were trying to get the vice president, Mike Pence, not to certify the election. Of course, it wasn't his role individually to certify the election, but they wanted him to declare and announce such powers and then to return the electoral college certificates to the states. And then they knew at that point, under the twelfth amendment to the constitution, there would be a failure of a majority in the electoral college. And the whole thing would be kicked over into the House of Representatives for a contingent election. And even though Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats were in control, they wanted to do that because they understood that under the twelfth amendment, we're not voting the way we usually vote on the basis of one member one vote, but rather on the basis of one state one vote. And they controlled 27 state delegations. And we had 22 on the Democratic side with one state Pennsylvania divided down the middle. So all of which is to say the common throughline here is certification. And certification takes place at every level. So yeah, I mean, this is the essential problem. And I think we will be dealing with some variation of it. I think it's unlikely we're almost impossible for it to come back again in the guys in which we saw it after all the vice president this time is Kamala Harris. And nobody thinks that she's going to do anything other than the Constitution able to forecast what the attack on the election will be. But I think knowing Donald Trump, we can all predict there will be an attack on the election. In fact, I don't think he's running a real campaign. I've been to 26 states now. I've been going all over the country and the Democrats are meeting and caucusing and knocking on doors canvassing. You can see vibrant grassroots campaigns everywhere. And you just never see anything like that on the Republican side. And even diminished lawn sign activity, which was something they used to have a lot of. So I don't know what they're going to try to do, but it does seem to me that their focus now is on passing laws that either get challenged at the local or state level or challenging laws at local and state level, trying to get some case into the court system to get up to the Supreme Court. And I think that their big hope is that the election will come down to one or two states and they will have cases in the docket in the pipeline to go to the Supreme Court because Trump believes that the justices that he packed and stacked and jerrymandered the court with in order to overturn Moe versus Wade will hang around in order to decide the election for him. But we beat Trump by three and a half million votes in 2016 in the popular vote even when he'd be Hillary in the electoral college in 2020, Biden beat him by more than seven million votes. And what's going to happen in 2024? Well, if you take that seven million vote margin, you add to a millions of young voters, we're going to have an even bigger popular vote spread. I mean, there should be something like 14 or 15 million new young voters. So I suppose what I'm most worried about is that he will be able to get some case into the federal system to get up before his friends on the Supreme Court. And if it's a close election and it comes down to one state, then it could be stolen from us. That's why when I go out on the road, I've been campaigning for a landslide. We don't want one of those bush versus Gore victories that can The Economist Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. This decision was like so. The Fed's decision to cut rates by half a percentage point is quite momentous. Over the last couple of years they've been on the war path against inflation, jacking up interest rates. They're now beginning to go into reverse. So it really reflects the Fed's view that inflation is not that big of a problem anymore. But there is quite serious concerns about the state of the labor market. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, made quite explicit last month that interest rate cuts were indeed in the pipeline. Where there was uncertainty was how big the rate cut was going to be. If we had spoken one week ago, I could have told you that just about everybody in markets where at that point expecting a cut of one quarter of a percentage point. But over the past couple of days that view changed. Markets began to expect a half point cut and indeed that is what the Fed delivered. Well, I think if you looked at the cut in isolation without hearing what Jerome Powell had to say about it, you might perceive it as a sign of concern about the state of the labor market. They could easily have done a quarter point cut. The fact they went for a bigger one suggests that they really think the bottom is beginning to fall out of the employment market. But the way that chair Powell explained it is that this is really about recalibrating monetary policy, trying to get it to a place where effectively it's neutral, where you don't have too much risk on either side of the picture. And that from here on forward, we may actually see smaller moves. This was just a way to catch up to where monetary policy ought to be. As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased. We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance. He said at several points that he was quite satisfied with the state of the US economy, that there was no recession in the offing. The US economy is in good shape. It's growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down. The labor market is in a strong pace. We want to keep it there. This really was intended to ensure that what is a pretty good economy stays that way. At the most general level, high interest rates slow in economy. They make it more expensive for businesses to invest money. They make it more expensive for consumers to borrow money. They slow down the property market. By beginning to lower interest rates, the Fed is basically taking its foot off the brakes somewhat, is beginning to ease a lot of those restraints. Now, it takes months and months for a rate decision to feed through. The economy is not going to look fundamentally different in a couple of days from what it looks like now. But it is a signal of the direction where the Fed is taking monetary policy. The Fed believes inflation is coming under control. And therefore, it is time to begin to ease the restraints on the economy and hopefully ensure that the labor market doesn't weaken any further from where it is right now. Yeah, that's right. There was one of 12 voting members on the rate committee who voted against the decision. It's symbolically interesting because this is the first time since 2005 that a member of the rate setting committee at the Fed has voted against the decision. Typically, there's utter unanimity. In the grand scheme, it's an 11-to-1 vote that's still an overwhelming decision to cut by half a percentage point. But I think what that reflects is that behind the scenes, there really was quite an active debate within the Fed about whether to cut by a quarter point or by a half point. This is, there was a big debate within markets about what the right size of the cut was going to be. By virtually any metric, interest rates in America are still relatively tight. I mean, the Fed believes that in the long run, interest rates should be closer to 3%, and right now they're sitting on 5%. So in the coming years, we will see more rate cuts. The question is, how quickly will those rate cuts come? How aggressive will the Fed be in the coming months? What the Fed laid out with its projections for the economy is that you will see inflation continuing to tick down in small increments. And the labor market weakening a little bit further. And if those two basic goals are hit, then they're basically setting things up for a step-by-step small incremental reduction in interest rates to hit that 3% level. The point with that picture though is that there's two basic parameters for the Fed when it makes its decisions. One is inflation, and the other is the unemployment picture. Mr. Powell was at pains to stress that if the unemployment rate goes up quite sharply, and inflation actually looks like it's really slowing much more than people have been expecting, we could well see another half-point cut at the next Fed meeting, which is going to be in early November, two days after America's presidential election. If however, inflation proves to be persistent, and we get a series of really strong job market reports, then it's entirely possible that the Fed will just keep rates where they are right now. If I were a betting person, I would say, yeah, probably next meeting, they'll cut by a quarter point. But as Mr. Powell himself said, that is not decided at this point in time. Well, the Fed was in a damned if you do, damned if you don't position. If they had opted for the smaller cut, the quarter point, a lot of Democrats would have been furious, believing that the Fed was taking undue risks with the economy in the lead up to the election. Having gone for the bigger rate cut, though, a lot of Republicans, including Donald Trump, will not be pleased. They'll believe the Fed is playing politics, that this is trying to deliver a boost to the markets, and that therefore this is something that's being done to boost Kamala Harris's chances. Mr. Powell stressed yesterday, as he has stressed on many occasions, that the Fed is an independent institution. We do our work to serve all Americans. We're not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It's just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. But of course, inevitably any Fed decision would have been a lightning rod or a political criticism given where America is right now in the election cycle. My pleasure, Rosie. Last week, I visited RAF Northhold. It's an airbase in Northwest London, and I was there to mark the 84th Battle of Britain Day. It's the country's annual commemoration of the Royal Air Force's successful resistance to the biggest ever Nazi raid on London. And it was a really poignant moment. A Lancaster bomber circled ahead, an RAF band played, and the chief of Air staff took the salute. The memorial seemed oddly resonant to what we're seeing today, of course, on the other side of Europe. In cities throughout Ukraine, this vicious Russian bombing campaign involving missiles, bombers, glide bombs is wreaking havoc. Ukraine is firing back with its own drones and missiles, but because it's getting most of its weapons from the West, it can't fight fire with fire. America and its allies won't let it. And in the past few weeks, there has been an intense public debate over whether Western countries ought to allow Ukraine to use their longer range weapons inside Russia. And we may well soon see a change in that policy. On the one side are concerns about escalation. Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, has said that Western arms landing deep inside Russia would cross a red line. He said that that would mean the West was at war with Russia. The Biden administration is cautious. It says that Russia has already moved a number of its fighter jets further east, so that the air bases are not as valuable as targets anymore. It's worried about escalation in a way that might drag America into a conflict with Russia. And also, there simply aren't a huge number of these long-range missiles, whether that's American ones or European ones. They are scarce, they are expensive. Ukraine has to be very, very careful with how it uses them. On the other side of the argument is Ukraine and many of its allies saying, if you can't hold Russian air bases and munition depots command posts at risk, Russia is enjoying sanctuary and that you simply won't be able to blunt Russia's offensive without taking the fight onto Russian soil. I think that as so many times in this conflict, Rosie, we've obsessed over one game-changing weapon. And one weapon is never game-changing. F16s are not game-changing. Long-range rockets are not game-changing. Long-range missiles won't be game-changing. And it is true, I think, as the Americans argue, that Russian aircraft have been probably moved out of range. However, I think it is also clear to me there are still a lot of Russian targets that would be within range. And to give you a sense of the range of an American attack on ballistic missile, which is one of the weapons we're discussing here, that's about 300 kilometers. So to be clear, you know, we're not talking about striking Moscow. We're talking about striking Russian command posts and barracks and depots within a couple of hundred kilometers of the Ukrainian border. And I think that would undoubtedly have some military benefit and it would undoubtedly ease some of the pressure on Ukraine's beleaguered forces inside Eastern Ukraine. We're really talking about two types of missiles. One of them is called attackums. That's an American ballistic missile. Ballistic means it goes up and down in a kind of ballistic arc. And the other one is called Storm Shadow. This is an Anglo-French cruise missile. The French called it Scalp. That is a very advanced cruise missile. Unlike a ballistic missile, it flies a bit like an aircraft quite low, quite flat. It doesn't go out of the atmosphere. It has an air breathing engine. It's very stealthy, equally very devastating. So those are the weapons we're talking about. But ultimately, the difficulty here is that America has a substantial say over how many of these weapons can actually be used in practice. It's a little bit complicated and no one knows for sure because this is also classified. But basically it's a couple of things. One is the construction of the missiles. There are some older batches of Storm Shadow that have American components in them. We don't know if the ones in Ukraine do or not, but in the past that's been a challenge because it means America has a say over whether they can be exported and presumably could also impose other conditions. I don't think that's really the big problem here though. The bigger problem, I think, is that if you look at how Storm Shadow navigates, it doesn't just rely on GPS, which a lot of other munitions do. It relies on a couple of other things. One of them is called inertial navigation, which is systems that tell the missile how far it's gone, the direction it's gone in, and it can kind of course correct. But the other one is something called terrain reference navigation. And what that means is the missile looks down at the ground, and it compares what it sees to a library of images it has on board. And by doing that, it can navigate to its target incredibly accurately, even in the face of intense Russian jamming. So that's obviously hugely important. But where does that data come from? Well, in some cases, we think it comes from American satellites and sensors. That means it's usually very tightly held within the Five Eyes Alliance, which is America, Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand. Now Rosie, the missile's still going to fly without that up to date data. But if you want it to be maximally accurate and you want it to really be sure of overcoming Russian defenses, you need that American data in many cases. And I think that is really what these ongoing discussions and debates are about. I think they can be. We've already seen America give permission to Ukraine to use some of its more basic short-range weapons systems on Russian soil to repel a recent invasion of Harkiv in the Northeast of Ukraine. And American military equipment has also been used in Kursk province during Ukraine's recent offensive. I also think the concern here, Rosie, it's not really about direct retaliation. It would be pretty stupid for Putin to attack NATO directly unless he's totally desperate because it would end very badly for him. I think what people are more concerned about is other kinds of retaliation. That could be an intensification of the Russian sabotage campaigns that we've been seeing in Europe that have been going up and up. But it could also be what experts call horizontal escalation, which is to say the same thing done somewhere else. And in particular, we know that Russia has had military intelligence officers inside Yemen working alongside the Houthis. Who are a armed group that's been firing Iranian-made missiles at shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. And the concern is they could provide the Houthis with more advanced missiles. I think another concern is that Russia could also transfer knowledge that might help with Iran's missile or nuclear weapons program. And we know that the US and the UK have been discussing intelligence suggesting troubling elements of that in recent days. I think that that would be a pretty drastic step by the Russians. But obviously you can't rule out that they would be willing to take some fairly risky steps in response. Well, Zelensky is going to the United States this week. We've just seen Kirsta, the UK Prime Minister talking to Joe Biden. Discussions are clearly at a very advanced stage. Some people think that really a decision has been made already. What I think is clear though is that we shouldn't expect a big public announcement. There's already a concern that all this public debate has allowed the Kremlin to seize the narrative to get its threats into the public domain before anything's happened. I suspect that if the decision is made and I think we probably are eventually going to see permission granted for these weapons to be used. If that happens, I think the first we are going to know about it is going to be a big bad explosion on Russian soil. That's right. Yeah, thank you so much for having me again. From Tokyo to Seoul, onto New York, London, Milan and Paris, there are more fashion weeks in September than there are weeks in the month. Recently, Odkuture has also been starring in some of television's most viewed and talked about shows. dramas have been trendy to start with. At the beginning of the year, we had Chris Bell Belenciaga, which looks at the Spanish dressmaker and 30 years of his career. He was called the Master of Assault by his pair Christian Dior. Then there was the new look, which looked at Dior and Kerkishnell during the Second World War. And lastly, we had becoming Carl Lagerfeld, which followed the German director before he took over as Chanel's creative director. But it's not just drama that's strutting across screens. There's also been several documentaries. There was one about John Galliano, a British designer. Yeah, I'm going to tell you everything. There was another about Diane von Ferstonberg, a Belgian designer of the famous rap dress. And there's more to come as well. Netflix recently announced a docky series focusing on Victoria Beckham's fashion house. There are a couple of reasons why fashion is so chic among television and film producers at the moment. One of them is just a pure storytelling perspective. This is an industry populated by creative, talented people, people who often rub up against their fellow designers, against their financials, against their colleagues. And these are all things that make for good stories. At the same time, fashion is very visual. And so it learns itself to an on-screen depiction. You can see a dress come to life in a very visually appealing and beautiful way. But there's another reason, which is that Hollywood is obsessed with brands at the moment. Studios are interested in making stories about popular products that people will recognise, be it Barbies or Ferraris. And content about cuturias at the same time is a safe bet as people will know the names Chanel, Dior, Balenciaga, even if they don't know about the people behind the brands. A crucial part of why these stories are making it to the screen is that fashion houses themselves are getting more involved in the storytelling process. If we think back to the Devil Wears Prada, which was released almost 20 years ago, lots of fashion brands were unwilling to begin with to lend their clothes for the film because they were slightly worried about incurring the wrath of Anna Winter, who inspires Meryl Streep's character. But that's not the case today. A Blenciaga and Dior both gave their blessing for Christopher Blenciaga and the new look respectively. They opened up their archives to the storytellers. And as a result, you can see the clothes represented a lot more accurately. And as one author told me, it's a way of them controlling their image and controlling the way that their brand is being presented on screen. And television offers an opportunity as well for these brands. Dior, for example, released a new fragrance around the time of the show's release. Dior is not the only fashion brand spotting the opportunities available on television. Some have gone even further in blurring those boundaries between branding and entertainment. Balmamm, for instance, in 2021, developed a series to showcase its latest collection. Chanel has also helped to finance films that star Kristen Stewart, one of its brand ambassadors. If you saw Spencer, the recent film about Princess Diana, you'll notice that Miss Stewart is wearing rather a lot of Chanel in that film. And search is for Chanel products, particularly bags and sunglasses and blazers really spiked in the wake of that film's release. And some are going even further than that. San Laurent has set up its own production company. It's kitting out characters in its clothes and providing stars with its gowns and things for red carpet events. This trend and the wealth entertainment about fashion brands reflects the changed media landscape. Luxury fashion is expected to make 116 billion this year, up from 86 billion in 2020. But the old ways of reaching consumers are not really working in the same way. One person I spoke to told me that you're just not going to reach your whole audience and vote anymore. And so entertainment has become a new advertising platform for these fashion brands. It's a way for them to show off their wonderful creations. And for now it seems to be working. Audiences are watching these shows and fashion bosses will be pleased and smiling unlike the models on their catwalks. But fashion brands going into entertainment should beware because what can seem alamo today can very easily become a passate tomorrow. The world is a world of fashion. The world of fashion is a world of fashion. The world of fashion is a world of fashion. The world of fashion is a world of fashion. The Economist It appears to have officially started in a moment unlike anything we've seen in decades. Tonight American officials worry that over time the mission could expand. Late on Monday night the Israeli army announced that its troops had invaded Lebanon. They are describing it so far as a small ground offensive involving a limited number of commandos but also promising that the offensive will expand on Tuesday, something that would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago. The stated purpose of it is to destroy Hezbollah's military infrastructure along the border with Israel. Bunkers and punnels and other things that Hezbollah has built there over the course of decades. And for residents of northern Israel, for the 60,000 people who have been displaced by rocket fire over the past year, they say getting rid of that military infrastructure is a prerequisite for them feeling safe enough to go home. They're worried about the prospect of attack from across the border. I think the question and the concern for many people in Lebanon, many people around the world, is whether this supposedly limited invasion is going to remain a limited invasion and whether the Israeli government has any exit strategy in mind or any plan for getting out of it. It's not clear how they are responding so far and it hasn't been clear for the past two weeks, how they are responding to anything that Israel has been doing to the attacks on pages and walkie talkies two weeks ago to the campaign of air strikes across Lebanon and of course to the assassination of top commanders and of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. All of that has happened in the course of two weeks and I think it has left the militia reeling. It's struggling with command and control. Its commanders have been killed, its communications network has been disrupted and it's not entirely certain yet how it wants to respond. And so we've seen in terms of the rocket fire aimed at Israel, it has kept up rocket fire on northern Israel. It says it is now targeting the area around Matullo, which is a town in northern Israel where many of these troops have been staging the Israeli troops who are going into or preparing to go into Lebanon. But we haven't seen much beyond that. It hasn't unleashed as many Israelis feared that it would. It hasn't unleashed hundreds or thousands of longer-range missiles aimed at Tel Aviv. It hasn't significantly escalated its barrage. I think it will also be preparing defenses on the ground and that is an area where it might have an advantage. It doesn't have any response to Israeli air strikes, to Israeli bombardment, but Israeli troops going into very difficult terrain in South Lebanon, terrain that Hezbollah has been preparing for many, many years to fight on is something that is likely to be much tougher for the Israeli army. Not much at this point. The only person who have been confirmed killed in these Israeli air strikes at the moment is a presenter on Syrian State Television. And it's very hard to imagine that she would have been the main target of a strike. So we don't know what they were aimed at, but they fit into, of course, what has been a very lengthy campaign of Israeli strikes. Not just in Lebanon, but in Syria, across Syria, aimed at Hezbollah fighters and commanders who were there, aimed at Iranian commanders who were there, aimed at military equipment, rockets, missiles, other things that Iran might be trying to send to Lebanon via Syria. Syria has been in Israel's crosshairs for the past year and actually for years before that, throughout the Syrian Civil War as well. America is simultaneously calling for a ceasefire and supporting a ground invasion, which might seem contradictory. If you think back just six days ago, the Biden administration insisted that it was close to brokering a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, and that would create more space for diplomacy about a permanent arrangement. That was last Wednesday. Two days after that, Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, and no one is talking about a ceasefire anymore. The administration for weeks had insisted that a ground invasion of Lebanon was a red line. It was something they wouldn't support. Now that Israel has gone ahead with that ground invasion, the message from Washington is that we supported, as long as it stays limited, we don't want to see it become an all-out ground invasion, a much larger one where the Israelis decide to stay. The Biden administration has, not just with Lebanon, but throughout this past year, set red lines, told the Israelis not to do things. And then once the Israelis do those things, the administration has turned around and said, well, actually we support it, but don't do this next thing. And that has been the pattern throughout the entire year. It's a pattern that I think has done tremendous damage to America's reputation across the Middle East, not just from people who think that it's a moral outrage, but also just on pragmatic grounds. America now seems like a superpower that is being led by the nose by a client state, and that does not make it look like a superpower in the eyes of many people in this region. That's always the risk with invasions. That's always been the risk and the history of Israeli invasions of Lebanon. It's a real concern. If you take the Israeli army at its word, that it is invading to destroy Hezbollah's military infrastructure along the border, imagine it does that, it withdraws its troops. There's nothing at that point to prevent Hezbollah from trying to come back. And so the Israeli army might be tempted to occupy some bits of territory in South Lebanon. This outpost there would then become targets for Hezbollah, and it might have to send more troops to reinforce the ones who are already there, and the logic of any invasion always tends to be expansionary. And I think it's a particular concern with this Israeli government, Prime Minister Netanyahu, has spent a year refusing to even talk about Israel's exit strategy from Gaza, pursuing a war there that even many Israeli generals will say has turned into a forever war that doesn't seem to have any clear goals or any clear way out. And there is a lot of concern, not just in Lebanon and other Arab countries, but also within Israel, that the government is embarking on a similar sort of operation in Lebanon. The Liberal Democratic Party, the LDP, has been in charge in Japan for most of the period since World War II. They've only lost power briefly twice. But they're in a bit of a crisis now. There was a financial scandal that broke late last year, and it really dragged the party's ratings down, and it proved a death blow for Kishitafumio, the outgoing Prime Minister, who announced in August that he would not be running for re-election. This scandal also created some chaos within the party itself. It weakened the hold of the factions inside the LDP, and made from much more chaotic leadership election than we've seen in recent years, a field of nine candidates with a pretty unpredictable outcome. Well, this is his fifth attempt at party leadership. So he's clearly got a lot of perseverance, but there's also a reason why he didn't win any of his previous attempts. He comes from a lineage in the LDP that runs back to a post-war leader named Tanaka Kakue, a regional focused infrastructure, shoelether campaigning style of politics. He's from Tottori, which is in fact Japan's least populist region. It's on the northern coast of Japan's main island. It's sand dune filled rural prefecture. His father was also a politician from the region. He's in some ways an outsider in the modern LDP. He left the party in the 1990s, which made many of the older generation of LDP figures as a traitor. He was kind of a gad fly when he returned. He liked to criticize Abe Shinzo, the late former Prime Minister. And he's known for being a bit of an otaku, a nerd, a geek, an obsessive, a wank. He likes to collect model planes and warships when you go into his diet office as I have the first thing that sort of stands out as these shelves full of these model trains, model planes, model warships. So he's a real detail oriented obsessive type, but he also has a bit of a populist flair of a particularly Japanese variety. He's a train enthusiast. He's a ramen enthusiast. Those are big national pastimes here. So he's quite popular amongst the broader public. In fact, he's consistently the most popular politician amongst LDP leaders. It's a great question. I think one of the fault lines is one we saw play out in the second round of this election between a harder edged version, a harder edged vision of Japanese nationalism and Japanese foreign policy, which Takahichi Sanaya represented. And what Ishiba has called for, which is a more of measured approach. He also, I think, on the economic side of things tends to be focused more on forgotten prefectures, on regional revitalization, on helping the parts of Japan that are most affected by it. It's aging demographics and by the concentration of wealth and power in urban centers like Tokyo. He has a bit of a liberal streak on social issues. For example, he supports the right of married couples in Japan to have separate surnames, which has become a litmus test for issues of sexism and family policy in Japan. So he calls himself sometimes a conservative liberal, which might sound like a bit of a paradox, but I think it hints at how he contains both strengths, a more liberal strain within the LDP, but also fundamentally conservative nature. So he's said a number of things during the campaign that have folks in Japan and abroad a little worried about his priorities. I mean, he's made some contrarian almost intentionally provocative comments about, for example, the necessity to create a broader collective security system in the region, something akin to an Asian NATO as he's called it. He's talked about revising the status of forces agreement, which is the legal basis for the relationship, the alliance with America. And what actually lies behind this is a sense that Japan needs to do more to make the final push to revise its own post war identity to take on more of the burden insecurity for itself and for the region. These are ideas that are very hard if not impossible to implement. And I think that Ishiba himself knows this. So having spoken in recent days with several people who are going to be entering his administration, the message I'm hearing is continuity that they are going to be inheriting the policies of the outgoing Kishita administration that they aren't going to be swarving wildly off course, that there are ideas of course that the candidate put into the air during the campaign. But these are just ideas not necessarily a road map for their governance. So I think we can expect a measure of policy continuity broadly speaking, but not necessarily stability because the nature of Ishiba's victory, someone who is deeply disliked by his fellow party members doesn't have a lot of close allies, is dependent on support from several former prime ministers to win this runoff. It makes for a very unstable administration. And so the question folks are asking here in Japan is just how long is he really going to last? Thank you for having me. There's nothing wrong with a sandwich and there's absolutely nothing wrong with lunch, but put them together and you get one of the worst two word combinations in the English language. Competition is tough, surprise party, cruise holiday, rice pudding, keen golfer, but sandwich lunch spells unmitigated disaster. Whatever plans you had for lunch, a ruined by an email from your boss telling you your break will be spent in a meeting room with several of your colleagues. Samwiches will be provided, it says. You have no say in the food on offer and the choices appear to have been made by a six year old. Samwiches cut into triangles, paper plates, you have expect party hats to be handed out. The fillings are unidentifiable, is that cheese or polyurethane, taking a bite offers no further clue. Not that you actually do much eating, etiquette dictates that you take less than you actually want. Your plate makes for depressing view II sandwich triangles, four crisps, a soggy salad leaf and one cherry tomato. It's about as appetizing as a cup of sand, trying to eat any of it is a lesson in the perils of eating and working. crisps are never noisier, then when eaten at a sandwich lunch every crunch thunders through the room. Attempts to spear a tomato with a plastic fork see it fly across the table and into your manager's lap. Untowerable bits of meat hang from a colleague's mouth as they realize too late that there is no way to bite through it. And people's opinion seems only to be sought once they've taken a bite of something, cue rapid chewing and a poorly suppressed belch. Their answer may be a good one, but everyone is far more interested in the spinach stuck between their teeth. Efforts to eat anything else as soon abandoned, the remaining sandwiches start to curl and yellow. There is still a full plate of delicious looking brownies in the middle of the table. Here the six year old has chosen well, but now that no one else is eating, there is an unspoken agreement that they should be left untouched. Someone else will get to scoff them later. And so when the meeting ends, you head outside so you can finally get some food. And we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine all along. and president Biden. President Zelensky is in America because it's an intense time for global diplomacy generally. The world's leaders are there for the UN General Assembly. But it's also a critical moment for Ukraine both diplomatically and on the battlefield. And we're ahead of an American election. So this is where a lot is going to be playing out in the coming weeks and months. Well, Ukrainians are still putting, if you like, maximalist demands. They have the moral high ground of restoring their full territorial integrity, including all the areas that Russia has occupied in the current war, but also Crimea. I think the trouble is that that's looking increasingly unrealistic on the ground where the war is a grinding one of attrition. And if anything, right now, Russia is gaining territory and is confident that time is on its side. In essence, Mr. Zelensky wants more and continued support from the West in the form of more weapons, permission to use weapons in more ambitious ways than Ukraine has had so far, including striking deep into Russian territory in order for Ukraine to defend itself better. And there's also the question of Ukrainian membership of NATO, which is an aim for future security guarantee. And the question of when that membership might actually come about to make the country more confident that it could resist Russia and Russian aggression in the longer term. Well, it's quite true that there's a pattern of President Zelensky coming to America and asking for more help, bigger packages. This time, I think, what's really different is the political situation in America as well as a situation on the ground in Ukraine. But in America, there's the awkwardness of an imminent election just a few weeks away now, and the outcome has an absolutely critical bearing on policy towards Ukraine and the fact that Donald Trump might again be in power very shortly is mind-concentrating. And then on the ground in Ukraine, the war is at a very tricky stage for the Ukrainians. Yes, they've shown that they can take some initiative by an incursion into Russian territory, but they're also facing huge difficulties on their own eastern front with Russian advances, small advances, but nevertheless, the prospect of retaking serious Ukrainian territory looks rather distant for now. Well, of course, almost everything these days in America plays into the election campaign and Republicans seize on things like presidents that are going to munitions factory in Pennsylvania, critical state, with Democrats running for a re-election. It's also true that it's hard to really discern what would actually happen if we had a new Trump presidency. You have people on either side of President Trump, some supportive of Ukraine, some like JD Vance, vice presidential candidate, who seemed particularly pro-Russian. And Trump himself saying without explaining really how that he would end the war in no time at all. And to Ukrainian is, that sounds very much like a recipe for really doing it on Russia's terms rather than Ukraine's. Yes, imposing a peace that would look very different from the one that President Zelensky laid out at the UN this week. We must ensure food security. We need to bring home all our captured soldiers and civilians, possibly deported to Russia. We must uphold the UN charter and guarantee our right. Ukraine's right to territorial integrity and sovereignty. And the question of NATO membership, which is dear to Ukraine, is something that President Trump, who has not been a very valuable supporter of NATO in the past, that would be problematic as well. Well, there's not a lot of sign of that yet. But at some point, I think a sense of realism will have to kick in. It will depend on the politics in Washington. But the long war that is already two and a half years in shows no real sign of ending, doesn't seem to favor Ukraine, given the Ukraine's problems of manpower, the difficulties, the setting its economy. It's got a very tough winter ahead with its energy infrastructure having been seriously downgraded by Russian missile strikes. So it's a question of whether a different, changed way of thinking, who come up with a package that would secure Ukraine's future as a Western-minded liberal democracy in the longer term with economic revival, even if it has to sacrifice some of its maximalist war aims. It's becoming more complicated undoubtedly. His popularity has been not sliding somewhat. There's different attitudes to the war, depending on particularly generational differences. Older people seem to be more bullish on the war than younger people. There are quite high rates of Ukrainian soldiers going, A. Well, so there's a much more mixed picture of politics back home in Ukraine. And at some point there will be elections. Rivals are already maneuvering to succeed, President Zelensky. So it's a very different situation from the early days of the war. Thank you, Jason. years into the war. In 1931, nine young African Americans were wrongly accused of raping two white women. They were known as the Scottsboro Boys, and they spent six years in jail. Later, all nine had their convictions overturned or pardoned after it became clear that they'd had an unfair trial. The story caught the attention of Leadbelly, an American folk and blues singer. In an interview he recorded where he spoke about the case, he gives one of the first uses of the word, woe. He was warning other black Americans to stay woke or watch out for people looking to get them in case they might be accused of something similar. Even the most committed anti-war warriors would admit he had a point. But since that time, the word, and those who champion it, has changed. The definition might be the hardest part of this Jason everybody has their own. The difficulty with the word is it's changed. Leadbelly used it in a positive sense and many people have used it in a positive sense in the past. Now it's largely used as a pejorative. The way I can see from it and the way we're going to use it in this discussion is that it's a world view which takes as red that progress, particularly on race in America, is impossible. That America's various problems are all systemic or structural and that the solutions to those problems tend to be things like positive discrimination on the basis of race in a very blunt way. There's also a tendency within this kind of thinking to ascribe people identities as members of particular groups and then categorize those groups as either being victims or oppressors. And that really flattens people's identity and misses a lot of nuance. Well less than was the case. So this is not just my assertion. We being the economist have done a lot of quantitative work on this. So we've looked at public opinion surveys, attitudes of Americans. We've looked at the language that's used in American media. We've looked at publishing universities, what corporations are up to. And what we found was there was a huge increase in wokeness of this variety in all walks of American life beginning in about 2016 and then it peaked around 2021 and has declined since then. How is it you've come to that conclusion? Well just to take one example, we did a huge study of the words that American media for the past 10 or 15 years to talk about racial injustice in America but not just racial injustice, lots of other subjects as well. And to use one example, the term white privilege was used two and a half times for every million words written by the New York Times in 2020 when wokeness was peaking. Last year it was down to 0.4 times per one million words. So that's a very steep decline. What happens in 2016, you may remember Jason is that Donald Trump is elected president of America and that has a profound effect on the country. It has profound effect on the American left. It strengthens those who had argued for a long time that America is irredeemably racist and sexist. You know, how could the country not be if it elected this man? Is the thinking on the left and the left wing of the Democratic Party? And that really squashes centrist Democrats, centrelf people in America. They're worried about being cancelled. You have the rise of no platforming universities, controversial speakers get prevented from addressing students. And then later on in this period when there's much more discussion about racial inequality in America and just to be clear, I think that's a very healthy discussion. It's a good thing that American society has this discussion in the 20 teens and into the early part of this decade. This gets taken up in corporate America in the late part of this period and you see in some cases managers getting rewarded, getting incentivized for hiring against DEI targets. And then since Joe Biden's election in 2020 and him being in all grades in 2021, this falls away very sharply. I think it is largely a political phenomenon. I think it came out of a feeling of powerlessness on the left when Donald Trump became president a feeling that politics as normal didn't work. And then when Joe Biden is elected, some of those concerns among activists on the left fade away, I also think the Democratic Party internalizes the lessons that some of the messages that it became associated with at peak woke, defund the police being one of them are politically toxic. We'll lose elections. And so you see the Democratic Party moving away from a lot of this stuff and some power and some influence draining away from this movement. I think you've seen the same thing happen on university campuses. The data on that is pretty definitive as well. It's true in companies, it's true in politics, it's true in American academic institutions and all of that I think is largely a change for the good. I think that's a good point. I don't think we've gone there and thank goodness. So if you look at our chart what they show is wokeness increasing through the 20 teens and then declining a bit from 2021. And I think that if you squint a bit you can say this is how progress is made. It's a good thing that American companies, American institutions looked at their role in racism in the country and perpetuating it and had a really hard think about that. And I think they will continue to do so. But what you've seen is some excesses of the movement. People being fired for no very good reason. People often feeling like they can't express their opinions for fear of being taken out of context or misconstrued. That seems to have gone away and that's good. Yes, that's right. This week's episode of checks and balance available in all good podcast shops will be about the subject about peak work in America, passing peak work will go in some depth into the work that the economist has done and will have a bit more time to chew over these ideas with Charlotte and Idris. So please come and listen to that if you're interested in this. You know I will, John. For now, thanks very much for your time. Thanks Jason. A new football season begins today and it's not the English Premier League or Spain's La Liga. It's the annual update of the world's favourite football video game. If you've heard that title sequence before then you've probably played FIFA, one of the biggest franchises in console gaming. FIFA's a football game that's been going since 1993 and it's become an absolute colossus in the gaming world that sells nearly 30 million copies a year. And on top of that it has a subscription product within the game which means that overall its revenues are more than $3 billion a year. The game accounts for nearly two thirds of the profits of its publisher Electronic Arts. I've been referring to this game as FIFA but actually these days it's not called FIFA. EA changed the name of the game last year to EA Sports FC. Now this was a bit unexpected because FIFA was one of the biggest names in gaming so why change it? Well the reason was that it's negotiations with FIFA for balls world governing body. Broke down it was reported that FIFA had asked for more money than EA had been paying it up until now. And so rather than pay that extra money EA decided to go for a huge rebrand of this big franchise. One year on it seems that this gamble has paid off. EA says that revenue from the game has continued to grow. They said that up to March revenue was up by a high teens percentage year on year. They gave an update in June saying that revenue from the game was up in the single digit percentages. It seems that it's continued to grow even without the FIFA name. One way that it's achieved that is through a big marketing blitz. So for example they've paid to sponsor the Spanish League La Liga which is now known as La Liga EA Sports. The deal with La Liga is an interesting one. It's brought them a lot of publicity through the name obviously but they've also managed to convince La Liga to change the format of its live TV broadcasts so that it more closely resembles gameplay from the FC video game. It's things like the fonts and the on-screen graphics have changed so that when you're now watching La Liga live on TV it looks more like you're playing FC. Losing the relationship with FIFA has hurt EA in some ways because obviously it's a very well-known brand but in other ways it's created some new opportunities. An interesting one is that it means that they can work with some of the commercial partners who previously were off limits. Nye can Pepsi for example were previously very difficult for EA to work with because FIFA is sponsored by Adidas and Coca-Cola who of course are the Arch rival of Nye can Pepsi. The big question is whether FIFA is going to hit back and they previously said that they will earlier this year FIFA said that it was working on a rival video game which it said will be the best like everything we do. We haven't heard anything much about it since it was rumored that Take 2 which is a big maker of games including Grand Theft Auto might be involved as a possible partner but earlier this year Take 2 seemed to downplay those rumours. Konami which makes a game called E-Football which are older listeners may remember as pro evolution soccer is another possible partner. The FIFA brand it's worth noting is going to become more valuable in the next couple of years because we've got a big World Cup coming up in 2026 in North America and people are particularly interested in this World Cup from a marketing point of view because they see it as a chance to interest Americans in football who of course so far have not shown all that much interest in the game. I think anyone's going to struggle really to compete with EA and FC at this stage. They've been pretty much at the top of the football video gaming business for about three decades now and this length of time has given them some powerful advantages. I mean one is they have these network effects because they've got so many players now who like to play against each other online that is quite difficult to break into the market. You know people like to play against their friends and if all your friends have got FC then that's probably what you want to play. The other big moat that EA has built is all its licensing deals now they've lost the FIFA deal but they still have literally hundreds of deals with individual footballers, with clubs, with leagues, the rights to have likenesses of particular stadiums and these deals are complicated and time consuming and very expensive to negotiate. Some of them are exclusive deals as well so somebody coming in even with the FIFA brand wouldn't automatically have the rights to all those other players, clubs, leagues and so on. It's going to be hard for anybody to really tackle FC whether they have the FIFA name or not. The Economist This is Amina. She's a widow living in Kabul in Afghanistan. She lives alone with her children. She told me she goes to clinics and hospitals, often on foot and alone, looking for work trying to get some money. To do this Amina has to leave her children at home. That's her seven-year-old daughter and her five-year-old son. She looks inside. And if there's food to eat, they eat. And if there's not, they wait until she gets home. Amina told me that she has no one else who she can rely on to support her or to look after them. Amina's situation as a widow and someone who is poor would be difficult in any country in any situation. But under Taliban law, she's particularly vulnerable because the Taliban wants women to be accompanied by men. And Amina said to me, what about her? What's going to happen to her? She needs to go out to work. Things have been difficult for Amina for a really, really long time. She was killed in a targeted killing. That was before the Taliban came to power under the previous government. But the Taliban seizing power has made life especially difficult for her. She told me that her life has now taken a time for the worse. In late August, the Taliban published a consolidated code of laws targeting mostly women and girls. And this consolidated code also gives new powers to their officers from the Ministry for the Propagation of Vice and Virtue to enforce these laws. And so what women fear is that now these officers will be emboldened and have this new authority to enforce these laws. And that could include, for instance, detaining and arresting women, which has already happened in some areas previously. One law that was new was that women can't raise their voices outside, recite the Quran in public, or look at any man that's not their relative. They were saying that, you know, it's been three years at first. They've been living with this constant announcements, which causes crisis in their lives, and they have to change and adjust their behaviors. And they've had to navigate living under Taliban rule for three years now. But there was something new that they felt, which was that things really aren't going to change or get better. They're going to get worse. And many women that I spoke to, even women who maybe had no plans to leave before said, maybe that's the only way out for them and for their children. And what reason of the Taliban given for these new restrictions? So I spoke to Sahel Shaheem. He is the man who would be the Taliban's representative to the United Nations. He is not yet, because the Taliban has not seen as a legitimate government, so they haven't made that appointment. When I spoke to him, he justified the new code. In fact, he told me that it was introduced to limit the powers of the morality police. And he said that the ban on women from speaking outside had been misinterpreted, he said, and I pushed back on him. I also asked him about things that couldn't be misinterpreted. For instance, the fact that girls can't go to secondary school. And I asked him if he had daughters and if they had completed secondary school. He told me that he has two daughters that married and they live with their families. But he didn't want to answer the question of whether they had attended secondary school or not. And he ended the conversation there. He did hang up the phone. That's a great question. And I think it touches on two things, which one is that there was this sense that among some people, they were saying, well, this is Taliban 2.0. They've changed. They want to be recognized as a legitimate government. They want to have relationships with the West. And some argued that this isn't something that they would do because they wouldn't put all of that at risk. But what we've seen is that it's not Taliban 2.0 at all. These restrictions have a depth and breadth that are absolutely comparable to the 90s. So since the Taliban sees power in 2021, the Afghan economy has basically collapsed. That's as a result of being hit by sanctions, also development aid being cut off. I mean, it's the situation with women. I think what Amina was telling me was she really hit the nail on the head where it was like, in an economic crisis where there's no jobs and things are so bad, how can you then put women out of work when they really need the money? They really need to feed their kids. And a woman who was, say, working at a beauty salon, she might have been supporting a family over 12. So I think there's a particular cruelty when it comes to the Taliban's policies in this context of economic crisis. So this reporting, I did also speak to a woman living in a rural area in the north of the country. So in a seabird, she's 28 years old. She's a midwife from a Bodhri's in a province in northwest Afghanistan. She goes out to work and her husband actually accompanies her to remote villages. But first when I spoke to her, she told me that, you know, I have to live here. I've adapted. And she was quite stoic. And later as we sort of got to know each other a little bit better, she told me that her hair was falling out. She's underweight. She can't sleep when she sleeps. She talks to herself and her sleep. And the weight of living in Afghanistan and sort of this crisis of women's rights had started to affect her. And really how she sort of described the problem to me was that she has a daughter, her daughter's 10 years old. What I understood from Naseebah was that yes, you can adapt to an extent. But the crisis is right there. I mean, what's going to happen to her daughter? And also what's going to happen to her because she has a yearly sort of annual contract for her job. She's able to provide for her family at the moment. Or whatever her husband became ill and couldn't accompany her to work. Or if, you know, something happened and he died and living in that state where there is just this economic crisis. So she's really, she's hanging in there, but only just. That's what she told me. Again, thank you so much for talking to me. You're welcome. It was great to speak to you. Chinese EVs are really starting to take off in Britain. It's incredibly striking if you look at the data just a couple years ago, maybe three at most four percent of new EV registrations in Britain were Chinese brands. Now it's up to 10 growing quickly. And that's probably an undercount. That's purely Chinese brands. If you include joint ventures with European cars, if you include European car makers making their cars in China, the market shares increasing rapidly. So it's going to be shifting the British auto market. The core reason is they're pretty good cars. They're cheap. These cars actually have huge profit margin for the Chinese auto makers. So one thing that does scare some of their domestic competitors or the European competitors is that there's a lot of scope to cut prices still if they were even to make the same profit margins they did in China. But already they're very competitively priced. They tend to be quite well made. Their marketed is a quite lucks aspirational thing. A lot of the showrooms, many of the brands are in very swish bits of London. And the reviewers are generally quite positive. So people are taking their life into these cars. In varies by brand, but a lot of them are really trying to push something quite aspirational. So I was walking home from work a couple weeks ago as I was reporting this piece and swung by the showroom for BYD, which is one of the major Chinese EV automakers. And the strategy they seem to be pursuing is putting their showrooms in really quite lucks places. So the one I was walking past was in Mayfair. It's a very swish part of London. Just down the road for a Rolls-Royce dealership. More recently they've opened one in Canary Wharf, which again, a high-end business district. So they're trying to clear double-game or on the one hand, the pricing is really competitive and that's a core part of their appeal. But they seem so far not really to pushing the notion that they're bottom basket cheap models, but rather they're offering something that's genuinely quite swish and lucks and exciting. The difference in Britain really is the government response. And so we're seeing a wave of quite a hostile, protectionist response to these cars across the west, of course, famously United States, including big tariffs, European Union as well. More recently, Canada's followed suit. And so among the kind of major Western economies that were Britain and Japan, the ones that stand out for not having moved so far and the Labour government, the Newly-Legs Labour government in the UK has mostly said they're pretty happy to wait and see and aren't pushing for the kind of investigation that would lead to tariffs so far. So whereas a lot of these are the markets, the Chinese car makers either aren't trying. That's kind of the case for a lot of brands in the US or if they are, they're sort of accepting they're going to be facing a bit of an uphill struggle. But for example, there's a lot of the EU in Britain they really do have a chance to grow quite a bit of market share. And most of that's a great thing. These are cars that are genuinely quite good, are really quite cheap and British households seem to be taking to them. It's a bit of everything. So particularly countries like Germany, which are very hefty domestic, order industries, the US as well, there's a lot of concern about your classic trade protectionism dynamics about jobs domestically, what happens to them. And of course, there is a very real security dimension to this. These cars aren't just boxes you get around in, but they're effectively giant computers. They have cameras facing the road, sensors inside, they connect to your phone, could well microphones for voice commands. China is very aware of these things too a couple years ago. China actually banned Teslas from military facilities on the basis they weren't comfortable with the amount of sensory apparatus in Teslas being in places that secure. And most likely Western countries that haven't arrived, you're going to be doing very similar things. But certainly that's unlikely that BYD will be making ministerial cars in the UK anytime soon. But the broader question of what's successful for British consumers, particularly in a world where we readily accept Chinese-made toasters, refrigerators, even iPhones and so on, seems a lot more nuanced and most likely the security case for banning them is pretty weak. Certainly it's a conversation. The security dimension is pretty real and still being discussed. On the trade side, there are also conversations that difficulty in Britain, part of it is the government seems less keen to move, even though Labour ran on a so-called secure onomics platform that skewed quite protectionist. The implementation of that in office so far has not been that aggressive. The other dimension in Britain is the political economy of the car industry a little different, and so in particular, a big chunk of the British car industry is your top high end brands. And those brands actually do have quite a big Chinese export market that are quite keen to preserve. A lot of Chinese tycoons quite like the idea of driving around a nice rolls-roise for the streets of Shanghai. And so the notion of retaliatory tariffs that China might lock off that market is pretty worrying to them, and they're not obviously domestically as worried about a flood of cheap Chinese EVs given that's not really their markets. The other dimension to this, of course, is that there's no reason necessarily that China would confine its retaliation just the car industry. And so there are plenty of other industries where Britain has large exports to China that could be a concern. One particularly that comes up when you talk to people about this are the Scottish whiskey and salmon industries. That's partly because those are again things where Chinese consumers are quite an appetite for them, but also, of course, the politics of Scottish nationalism, the Labour parties, the rebound in Scotland, so on, is very fraught. And so if you were a shrewd Chinese trade operator trying to work out where to inflict the maximum political pain, that could well be a place to look. To my shame, I don't possess a driving licence, and so I wandered around the showroom peered at them and had some chats, but I've not yet actually driven one. Thank you. I'm Emily Cooper, and I'm so excited to be here in Paris. When the first series of Emily and Paris came out, it was absolutely ridiculed in France. It's about Emily, the fictional character who is played by Lily Collins. I'm looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you, and likewise having you get to know me. Where are you shouting? She's a young social media exec from Chicago who's transferred by her firm. Has anyone noticed this is a very dysfunctional workplace? I think you're the one bringing a drama. What? The series is now on its fourth season, and astonishingly, it's become France's most watched Netflix series. Look, I know you haven't warmed up to me yet, but I promise you will if you get to know me. I don't want to get to know you. I've watched it partly out of curiosity because I live in Paris, I work in Paris, and it's always interesting to see how Hollywood depicts the city, and sure enough, it was as full of as every one of those Instagram-able cliches, as you can imagine, at the beginning, and the French hated it. So what was it that they particularly hated? It was everything, really. It was the fact that the French were depicted as either mean or lazy, or both. They were incorrigible flirts. There was no plot, or at least it was extremely circular, and the characters were a pastiche of the French. And sure enough, the French critics laid into it. One critic said he felt so sick, it was as if he'd eaten all the macarons in a box. In America, Emily in Paris was eminuminated, but in France, it has never been up for any TV-a-ward at all. Well, it's the North Fadomenon, to be honest. In series four, there's not a lot that's changed. It's the same old love triangle. The dialogue is still vapid. This costume still is outrageous. And there are a few novelties like a pseudo-ferscapade to Rome. There's even a cameo performance by Brigitte Macron, the president's wife. Emily, is it you? I'm following you on Instagram. Yes, yes. I adore your country. And my wife, you adore Emily. Thank you. Is it possible to prondera and photo of Evie Vous, if you play? Me, Evie, please. Oh. But I think one factor may be more use of the French language. Well, it is, and that hasn't changed. But what has changed is that the dialogue between the main French characters is increasingly in French. So when Sylvie, who's Emily's boss, speaks to her colleagues or to her husband or to her lover, it's often now in French. And that, I think, makes it much more accessible to French viewers. At the beginning, Darren star, the series creator, was worried that too much French language would put off Americans, but he seemed to have decided otherwise for series four. though? I wonder if another factor isn't that there is a Me Too storyline in the fourth series. It's a subplot, but it does make the show feel a bit less ridiculous. France, I think, as a whole, came late to Me Too, but this storyline does chime with a younger generation who are a lot less tolerant of the behaviour that their mothers or grandmothers would have accepted. And Emily's boss, Sylvie, calls out a past sexual harassment case. Men like Louis de Lilleau need to be held accountable for their actions. Right. So that could be a factor that helps make the French warm, more to Emily and Paris in season four. Well, it could be that. Often when you talk to prisons, they do a lot of moaning about their capital. They usually talk about the rats and the road works. They grumble about overcrowded metros. But just like the Olympics, it may be that Emily and Paris is a sort of reminder to the French that their own city is beautiful, and that a lot of people are in love with France because of their city's splendor. So possibly they begin to see that there's a value in Emily and Paris. You have brazen brand placement in series four luxury goods have done well that have featured in the show. Americans seem to have a better impression of the French just for having watched the series. So perhaps this is about France feeling better about their capital than they did. I think ultimately that's exactly right. And the French have gone through a pretty difficult period themselves. Olympics apart, they've had some pretty hairy elections. And I think that it's sometimes just a way of suspending reality and indulging in a bit of vacuous fluff. And the French team at the end of the day is ready to do that as anybody else. Sophie, it's a pleasure to speak to you as always. Always good to speak to you too Rosie. Thanks a lot. The Economist I just want to see why my house is not selling. Sixty is all tough question. This is a make-or-break deal. We're talking about a million dollar commission here. I don't know how much more I can take. A federal jury in Missouri on Tuesday found that the National Association of Realtors liable for artificially inflating commissions and awarded plaintiffs 1.8 billion dollars in damages. The problem is that brokers used that information and system to collude to essentially set rates for buyer agent commissions. We got through to the National Association of Realtors and we said there's two choices. We can either bankrupt your industry with this verdict or you can quit doing it. We're just brand new into this and people don't change that fast. I think though, over say a longer term period, say five to ten years, I do think we'll win six significant commission commission. Hi, Mike. We on the listing side know what we need to market the home and that's 3%. This is something that I've developed to illustrate what might incentivize the agent representing the buyer to bring them to your home. We can offer 3, 3.5, 4 or 4.5%. So every agent that looks at this knows how much they're going to get paid. This agent is offering 3%. This agent is 2.5%. I've been around the water cooler in my office enough to know that some agents aren't going to show the 2.5%. Everybody's going to show a 3, and some agents are going to go out of their way to show the 3.5% listing. The problem is that brokers use that information and system to collude to essentially set rates for buyer agent commissions. Keep in mind that all listing agents are also buyer agents of another sale. And all buyer agents are also listing agents of their sale. So their interests are essentially identical. There's no relationship between the prices that the brokers charge and the service that the consumers receive. He charged the same thing no matter what you do on a sale. A buyer agent who shows a buyer one property earns the same commission as a buyer agent who shows 20 properties. It's an auto-ac system. In Great Britain, the commission's average in their last survey I've seen. 1.2%. And if you project 1.2% onto the American system, that represents $60 to $70 billion in commissions every single year. So there's a lot at stake here and you can understand why the industry is fighting to protect the 5 to 6% commissions. On a typical home purchase, that loan could save folks an average of $10,000 on a sale or purchase. I'm calling on realtors to follow through on the lower than commissions to protect home buyers. the Corkerin Group. What it is causing is total confusion. Brokers are confused, buyers and sellers are confused. I even think the people who made the amendments are confused. So I don't think the ruling is a big deal, honestly. But the confusion that's causing is amazing. Hi, Alice. Thank you for having me. In the middle of probably 2017 timeframe, a really good friend of mine approached me and said, hey, we have this idea that we have with the real estate world and how they're conspiring and manipulating at the highest corporate levels to fix the system against home sellers to basically rip them off when they're selling their house and make them pay the buyer's commission. Is that something you'd be interested in talking to us about getting involved as a trial attorney? I'll never forget the day. They sat down here in my office in Kansas City, Missouri and told me the story. My wife and I had sold our first house. It didn't even occur to me that I had paid the buyer's agent. I was stunned. It actually made me feel stupid. Here I am, this lawyer, and I'm supposed to be sophisticated. My wife is a CPA. She's got a master's in tax in the county. She didn't even know that. When I started learning more about the system that's been in place for almost 100 years in the United States, I just thought this is just wrong. It's corrupt, it's collusion. And I thought, yeah, let's take this monster down. So people who've been involved and have bought or sold a house, remember this, there's something called the MLS, a multiple listing service. And when we first bought our house back in 1992, and it was like a phone book, and you would open it up and it would show pictures of houses, say how many square feet, how many bedrooms, what the taxes, utilities were, and how much they wanted for it. That's what they used. And sellers, agents would put their house in there, and buyers, agents would use it and swap it back and forth. And actually, this National Association of Realaders is the largest trade association in the United States that gives more money than lobbying than anybody else. They would set rules in place saying that they couldn't trade that book. They couldn't share that book with the public. And what they would do then is they would fix the commissions at 6%. And they would say, if you're selling the house, make the seller who has the money, who has the cash, pay 6% and split half of it to the seller's agent, 3% and half of it to the buyer's agent. And they would have that as the standard rule that they all followed. And half the time these corporations were making their money sell in the house, half the time they were making it, buying it. And so they were always making money. And so what happened when the internet came along, everyone thought, well, that's going to change it, it's going to disrupt it. The whole National Association of Realaders and all these real estate companies were worried that that was going to happen. So what they did is they set rules in place at this trade association in AR and that said, the only way you can list your house on the internet in the United States is if you agreed to pay a commission to the buyer's agent and they just had a strangle hold on it. That's kind of the system and that's how it worked. And it stabilized the prices. So all the prices then, all the commissions were right about 6%. And so we hired an economist and he went into the state of Missouri, they come in and they analyzed the data and they pulled all of the sales from 260,000 home sales over a five year period and they analyzed them all. And they said, look, if the free market was at work and people were really negotiating commissions, you'd expect a chart where prices were all over the different and scattered all around the commissions, but they were uniform. Right at a 3% buyer's commission. And so we realized that the data doesn't lie. So we knew it. We get their training materials and we get their stuff. And sure enough, they're having conferences where they're getting all their agents together, the CO standing on the stage, making the commissions 6%. They're training everybody, split the commissions between the two sides. They're doing things that the loss says you cannot do. And when we expose that and show that to the jury, we said in a free market that wouldn't happen. And they refunded every penny of the buyer's commissions that were paid by those Missourians in that five years. And that's what started the process that leads us to where we are today. We took the position unless they changed the way they're doing things nationwide that there's going to be no deal. That was the big point of contention with the National Association Realtors. We made them change the rules to prohibit any agent in the country from going on to the MLS and using that as a system for offering commissions and can even list commissions on there. Because what was happening is even if you went on there as a home seller and your agent voluntarily listed a commission, buyers agents would see it. And the word they use a steering, they would steer their clients away from places where they weren't paying a right commission. And it's pretty easy to do with an agent. If it's not paying this 3%, maybe you don't show them a house. Maybe there's more problems with the house. House then languishes on the market for a little while because no one's seeing it. So then the market, the people start thinking, well, that house has been on the market for 90 days and hasn't sold in this really hot market. There must be something wrong with it. When in reality it's just the commission. And when you set commissions like that, it affects that steering. So we said that has to change. And eventually we got through to the National Association of Realtors and we said there's two choices. Where you can either bankrupt your industry with this verdict under the law in the United States, they trouble the damages. So you get a $1.8 billion of judgment and I trust case they tripled it to $5.4 billion or you can quit doing it. So then they agreed to change these policies. And so now you can no longer anywhere in the country use a National Association to Realtors MLS to list these commissions. And it's going to take a while but we're starting to see this change, this kind of shift in this change. It's not just a victory for home sellers but it's also a victory for home buyers because the vast majority of people when they buy a home, this commission can be baked into the price of the house. It can prop up the cost of the house, right? You're going to sell a house, you need to pay off your mortgage, you need to increase the price to be able to pay the commission. What people often forget is the home buyer is usually had just sold a house. It's very common for people to sell a house and go buy a house. So if you sell it, even you have 3% more than you have more money to put as a down payment on your next house. And so I view it as a victory for home owners and it's going to be fascinating for me to sit back and watch the free market work. Now, thank you for having me and I appreciate you getting the story out to your listeners. Thanks for having me. This is wonderful. I'm going to say in general, there are two major changes that were made. One is that it requires that the buyer agent sign a buyer agent agreement, like a written agreement with the buyer before doing anything for them. It used to be that you could just go, the agent would meet you, show you the house, talk to you, and then chat and try and get you to sort of hire him. Okay, well, going forward, now before the showing, there has to be a written agreement. I think the idea was that they would have this conversation, okay, well, here's what I charge, and this is what it's going to be, and that the buyer is going to be financially responsible for that fee. The second major change was that the MLS can no longer talk about compensation. So the idea of the listing agent, the listing broker sharing that commission with a buyer agent, that was not outlawed. Like the set up that didn't say we're not going to compensate what it said was, you can't do it on the MLS. So it's completely off of the MLS system. Those are the two major changes. There are 2,000 other smaller changes that aren't really detailed, or have having to do it like MLS operations and data feeds and all this, but we can ignore them. Those are two big ones. I think that one is going to work. And here's why, under the settlement, like a brokerage, you are allowed to promote compensation on your own website by the phone, right? So let's say we're offering 2.5% compensation. I can put out my website, you know, of my listings, they say, hey, this is the house we're selling on behalf of the seller. We're offering 2.5% compensation. That is perfectly legal. If a buyer agent calls me and says, hey, are you guys offering compensation? I could say, yes, we are offering 2.5% compensation. Totally legal. Really it's tacky, but I could put up a yard sign at the house saying 2.5% compensation. Perfectly legal or perfectly within the settlement. I don't think that's going to be that big an issue because I think competition actually is going to take care of that. So I'm a seller. And then Asian comes in and we talk and say, okay, what's my house worth? This worth 500,000. Great. What do you charge? I charge 5%. Well, because 2.5% we're going to share it out of this compensation. The next Asian comes in and I say, okay, so what do you charge? I charge 2.5%. Well, what about the buyer? Well, we'll consider the buyer, you know, can request as part of the offer. Hey, we're going to pay 4.90. We're going to close in 30 days. And by the way, seller, would you be willing to pay my agent 2.5%. Right? So if those are the two choices, I feel like sellers are going to opt for the potentially cheaper choice every time. Here's the thing. It's going to take some time. Okay, this has been in place for 100 years. It's not like we're going to turn it a dime. Human beings can't change that fast. I think it's going to take 18 to 24 months before we see the most listing agents will just go to I charge what I charge. And then as far as buyer payments concerned, let's see what they ask for. Right? Let's see what they ask for in the offer and then one negotiator like any other terminal contract. It makes it very hard to blacklist. It makes it very hard to steer. I think it's also going to have a pretty big impact, but it's going to take even longer than the other rule change. Okay, and for 100 years in the US, the buyer's just assumed that everything was free. In fact, they used to be the buyer agents who had advertised their services as being free. Now that's not the case. And now the buyer is the one who has to pay the his own agent. And in theory, when you sit down with an agent, that agent is supposed to explain that to you. Hey, here's all the things I'm going to do for you. And this is what I charge. I'm going to ask the seller to pay most of that fee for you, but just so you know, you're the one who's kind of responsible for paying me. That conversation is going to give very interesting. I think a lot of agents are not good at having that conversation because they've never had to have it. Like, if you've never had to talk about, here's what I charge and here's what I'm worth what I'm charging, then it's going to take a little bit of time to kind of get used to that. The other thing of course is we don't know yet. And I think we'll go see from data. How much of buyers really willing to pay for buyer agent services? It's not clear. If you go on in social media, it feels like they don't want to pay anything. But you know, in real life, that's not really the case. Most buyers do want help. They are willing to pay. It's just, are they willing to pay $25,000? One of the difficulties there is it does introduce a lot of friction into the process. For buyers. That's a real negative. This is what I mean is, again, let's say I'm in Zillow, I'm not a serious buyer yet. I find the house. I just want to go see it. Now I have to go through this sort of presentation pitch with a buyer agent who's going to explain all this stuff. Like, by the way, you're going to be on the hook for you know, all this, you know, and then maybe we just go, hey, you know what, it's not worth to forget about it. All I really want to see a couple of houses in my neighborhood, right? So I do think what we'll see is, what's been referred to showing agreements. So these would be really simple, maybe three paragraphs. This is something like, you're retaining me for the next three hours to show you these homes. I'm not going to charge you anything. Maybe you're going to give me the opportunity to pitch my service to you at the end of it, right? That's it. You know, so no real commitment. Just quickly, like just, you know, sign in an iPad and now you can see houses. I think we're going to move towards that type of model. I think trying to interpret anything from signs we're seeing now is foolish. That's how it for it. Because we're just brand new into this and people don't change that fast. I think though over say a longer term period, say five to ten years, I do think we're going to see significant commission compression. I think there are roughly 1.6 million real tours where the members of NAR and there's supposed to be another million licensees. That's to have million people chasing roughly four million home sales a year. That's too many. How many should there be? Probably somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the current numbers. Are we going to get there? I don't think so. Not through this way. And the reason is, so if you look at the stratification of real estate agents, you have the top agents who are just doing incredibly well. A lot of them are clearing over a million dollars a year in their personal income. I mean, they're doing extremely well. And they're doing 30, 40, 50, 100 transactions. Many of them have built these agent teams around them with support staff and other agents like they really run a great operation. None of those guys are leaving. They'll figure it out. They'll figure out how to cut costs. They'll make it up in volume. Those guys are fine. The hobbies that you mentioned, they weren't selling anything anyway. So for them, it's not like they were making a profit. There's also a business for them at 2.5 percent. It's not a business for them at 1 percent. It's just once in a while, they kind of fall into a deal and maybe allows them to pay for vacation or something. Those guys aren't leaving because the cost of becoming a real estate agent number one is minimal. And to maintain your license once you have it is once again, minimal. So why not just hold on to it? The big problem is that middle where you have full-time agents who are actually trying to make a living doing this, those guys are going to get in real trouble. And I think that's a real loss for the industry, but it is what it is. So I think we're probably losing somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of agents initially. The thing is the industry knows this. So therefore, what we'll find I think is other reforms, other changes a few years down the line that we'll seek to get rid of the hobbyists. Because the hobbyists make it more difficult for the full-time professionals to make a living. Oh, this was really wonderful. Thank you for having me. The Economist There is still some uncertainty around the extent of the damage. We know that around 2,800 people were wounded according to the Lebanese health ministry, which also says at least nine people were killed, although the actual death toll is probably higher than that. Among those wounded, the Iranian ambassador to Beirut, the attack is a huge blow for Hezbollah, but it's unclear as of yet what comes next. Hezbollah was very quick to blame Israel and to say that Israel would get its fair punishment. Now, there has been no official comment from Israeli officials, and I suspect there will not be any comment from them in keeping with their usual policy of silence after these sorts of operations. But I think it's very reasonable to assume that Israel was responsible for these explosions. Its leaders have spent the past few days talking about a planned operation against Hezbollah. They've spent months talking about the need to restore deterrence. He's a V, Hezbollah and other Iranian back groups in the region. And of course, they have a long history of not just targeted assassinations, but operations that involve sabotage, for example, in 1996, killing the chief bomb maker of Hamas with an explosive planted inside of his mobile phone or in 2008, killing Hezbollah's military commander with a bomb planted inside of his SUV. So I think even though there has been no official claim of responsibility, it's quite plausible that Israel was behind this. No one else really has the both motive and capability to do it. There are two theories that we've been hearing since the attacks on Tuesday afternoon. Some people in Lebanon, including sources close to Hezbollah, are saying this was a cyber attack. They're arguing that Israel somehow caused the batteries inside these pages to overheat and burst. But I don't think that's what happened. Batteries tend to burn, not to explode, and neither the videos of these pages exploding, nor the very graphic images of injuries in hospitals are consistent with sort of a runaway battery fire. So I think what is far more likely to have happened is that Israel sabotaged the pages themselves quite early in the supply chains and inserted a small amount of explosives and a detonator into each page. I think that's the most important question, and then it's something that everyone has been debating. One possibility is that this was a prelude to a bigger Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the sort of offensive that, again, officials have been talking about for a number of days, and that would make sense if you were planning to invade Lebanon, a very tactically sound opening act in that invasion would be to knock out much of the command leadership of your enemy and to scramble the communications of your enemy. But so far we haven't seen any signs of a serious Israeli incursion. That suggests there might have been other reasons. Perhaps this attack itself was the big operation that Israeli officials were talking about. Perhaps they thought this was something big enough and public enough that it would humiliate Hezbollah and restore perhaps some measure of deterrence against the group. Or perhaps Israeli spies were worried that Hezbollah was close to discovering the sabotage. There's been some reporting over the past few hours that at least several members of Hezbollah had raised questions about the pages. They were worried that those devices might be compromised. And so maybe Israel thought it was about to lose this capability and decided to use it before it was compromised. It's a huge blow to the group. I think both in tangible terms and psychologically tangibly earlier this year, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah told the rank and file of the group to throw away their mobile phones. He said Israel could hack into those phones. It could use them for surveillance. It could use them to target assassinations. And so it simply wasn't safe to carry a mobile phone anymore. And the pages were meant to be a low-tech, more secure alternative, something that was almost too old school to hack into and penetrate. And obviously that turned out to be wrong. But everyone has now thrown away their mobiles and the pages that were supposed to replace those phones have proven to be compromised. So I think that's going to at least in the short term paralyze some of Hezbollah's military capabilities because it will be very, very hard for the group to communicate. So there's a real impact there. Beyond that, there is just the embarrassment of having its communications network compromised in such a public way. And there's the fear of if Israel had this capability, if it revealed this capability, what else might Israel be able to do? And so you talk to people in Lebanon who are close to Hezbollah and they say the group is in a state of shock as it reels from the impact of these major bombings. I think though the one other interesting and perhaps significant development is what this means for the Lebanese population writ large. There are a lot of people in Lebanon who have spoken to who are not necessarily supportive of Hezbollah but who view these major bombings as not an attack on the group but as an attack on the country as a whole. And so it may at a time when Hezbollah is increasingly unpopular amongst many ordinary Lebanese. These attacks may have done something to boost their popularity and create a rally around the flag effect in Lebanon. It's too early to say, but I agree. I think this is being seen in Lebanon as a significant escalation and Hezbollah will want to retaliate in some way. I also don't think it's in any position to retaliate right now because of the damage to its military apparatus, to its communications network. And so I think it's going to take some time before the group decides on a response. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah is due to speak on Thursday afternoon. So we'll wait to see what he has to say and what its leadership decides to do from there. There's also a question of what Israel chooses to do now, even if it didn't intend for this to be a prelude to a military offensive in Lebanon. It's possible that some Israeli generals will now look at Lebanon. They will see Hezbollah reeling from this attack and push for a bigger incursion, even if that was not the original plan. So like so much of what Israel has done over the past year, you can describe this as an operational success, but the longer term strategic consequences of this attack very much remains to be seen. Thank you. We design the F-150 to be tough. Silverado, it's the right truck. We're ram. Trucks are what we do. Each year cars kill around 40,000 people in America. And when you look at it on a per mile basis, the country is about twice as dangerous as the rest of the rich world. So given the scale of this problem, I decided to dig into the numbers and find out why. So we pulled together 10 years worth of crash data from 14 states. And we were left with a big data set of around 7.5 million crashes between two vehicles. And when we crunch the numbers, we found that as expected, heavier cars are safer for their passengers than lighter ones. But then when we looked at deaths in the other cars, the cars that they crashed with, we found that the heaviest vehicles, so those top 1% of vehicles, they were responsible for 37 deaths for every 10,000 crashes that they were involved in compared to around 6 for like a typical car. So the net result of all that is for every life that the heaviest SUVs and trucks save more than a dozen lives are lost in smaller vehicles. One of the big reasons is the regulation that car makers face in America versus the rest of the world. So America's top regulator, which is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, they give out safety ratings each year to new cars. And those are based on crash tests. And they're all based on the safety of the occupants of the vehicles in question. But they completely ignore the consequences for others on the road. So that means that when they're rating, let's say, a 10,000 pound pickup truck, even if that truck just destroys everything its path, every single crash results in a serious injury or fatality, if that truck protects its own driver, it will earn a five star safety rating. That is a big difference from in Europe where the regulators take account of the safety, not just for the driver of the car, but others on the road. Well, I pose this question to folks that I spoke to for the story. And a lot of people were kind of skeptical of that argument. They said Americans like big cars for a lot of reasons. They're roomier. They can toe things. They can do work in sort of more rural places with them with these big trucks. They're more powerful. They sit higher up on the road, so they have better visibility of the road. So I think there's a lot of reasons why Americans love big cars. And I think safety is probably not the top one. And there's a lot of other reasons too. I mean, policies around regulating cars incentivize Americans to buy the bigger trucks and SUVs. So America's tax system subsidizes heavier vehicles by setting more lenient fuel efficiency standards for light trucks. And then there's also big tax breaks for companies that buy heavy-duty vehicles for their business. They can deduct a big portion of that cost when they're filing their tax seats here. So you're just seeing bigger and bigger trucks and the electrification of vehicles of the fleet is only going to make this problem worse. One source that I spoke to said that it's going to put this problem on steroids is what he said. So basically when you add a battery to a car, it adds thousands of pounds of weight. These batteries have to pack a lot of energy. And so you have the combination of these two factors. You have Americans preferring to buy big SUVs and trucks. And car makers moving towards electrification. And so it just makes these vehicles even bigger. And one sort of eye-popping stat that I came across writing a story was that the GM Hummer EV weighs around 10,000 pounds. And the battery pack alone weighs about as much as a Honda Civic. You could try to crack down on this problem. You could place limits on the weight of the vehicles that people could drive without a commercial license. So in America, someone with a regular license can drive a vehicle that's 26,000 pounds. And in Britain and the rest of Europe, you basically can't drive anything that's bigger than around 7 or 8,000 pounds. So you could restrict the weight of the cars that regular people can drive. You could try to regulate it so that the car makers just can't build these kinds of vehicles that weigh this much. I don't think that will be successful in America. I mean, everyone I spoke to said it would be politically basically impossible to try to restrict these types of vehicles from getting on the road. The other options are more about encouraging consumers to buy lighter cars and discouraging them from buying heavier ones. So District of Columbia places a weight-based tax on your car when you register and other states could do that. You know, America could get rid of some of the tax incentives that encourage car buyers to opt for these bigger vehicles. Most of these policies are pretty unpopular though. So I think there's not much we can do about this particular problem. Well, I think there's a few things we can do that might be easier than trying to limit what consumers can buy. We can try to reduce speed limits and actually enforce those limits, design safer roads with more roundabouts rather than intersections. And a lot of the car makers that I spoke with, they change the subject. They sort of say, well, we have all these crash avoidance technologies that help drivers. So they're never going to get into a crash in the first place. But no matter how clever the technology is that's in these vehicles, crashes are inevitably going to happen. And as long as we have these behemoth trucks and SUVs on the road, they're going to be more deadly. Yeah, thanks for having me. At the end of summer, I got up at the crack of dawn and went down to a stretch of beach on England's Jurassic coastline. I was there to meet professional fossil hunter Lizzie Hingley. Hi, I'm Lizzie. Hi, nice to meet you. It is treasure hunting. Anyway, it's one of the only places where you can still treasure hunt. I mean, even here, like, these are bits of feather light, which are pieces of like prehistoric squid. As well as hunting for fossils, Lizzie prepares them in her workshop. Spending days carefully chiseling remains from rocks. For a lot of people, it's sort of therapy, you know, charmeth and the Jurassic coast is their sort of happy place where they come to. So, you know, it's sort of just kind of everything else melts away. You've got the noise of the sea, you've got stuff taking over your vision with the beautiful fossils. You know, you've got this sort of beauty when you look up. You're like, wow, look at that. Despite it being first thing in the morning, Lizzie and I aren't alone on the beach. The shoreline is packed with people searching for fossils. There's gangs of small children wielding hammers, and they're all searching for fossilite ammonites. Those are small squid-like creatures that swam in a shallow tropical sea hundreds of millions of years ago. They're mostly preserved in pyrex, which is otherwise known as Fools Gold. And this stretch of coast is absolutely full of them. It has a near-perfect geological record from the Mesozoic era. That's between 66 and 252 million years ago. The rocky beach is surrounded by cliffs, and frequent landslides bring the cliffs in its contents all the way down to the beach. It's probably down. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so watch out, feel that fresh stuff there. There's no sea being on it. But this is a kind of slow thing. I know, it's so kind of. One expert I spoke to described it as like fossils on a conveyor belt. So this video is called fossil hunting tips and tricks, and one of the tricks is to get out of bed early in the morning. Videos on social media really drive the enthusiasm. They often show rocks breaking apart to reveal perfectly formed fossils after only one or two taps with a hammer. An excitement about these finds is leading people astray. Emergency services on the Jurassic Coast have recently rescued fossil hunters from cliff edges and mudslides. Good afternoon. How are you doing? Fine, fine. How do I suggest we try and stay on the beach? Oh, yeah, thank you. It's nothing. This stuff here really is very, very upstabbing. That's right. Stuart Godman is a fossil warden. His job is to persuade people to hunt on safer ground. We want people to feel fossil hunting, but we want them to do it safely. We want them to go away and come back again another time. Whereas if they end up underneath the big rock, they're not going to come back. This stuff here really is very, very unstable. Although the vast majority of all-breakers are polite, Stuart did tell me that occasionally someone throws a wobbly as he puts it. The bounty may be encased in Fools Gold, but the returns are real enough. On eBay, fossils advertised from the nearby lime regions were on sale for an average of £100. Some one's sale for as much as £1600. And that may explain some of the more risky behaviour. In November 2023, police apprehended two fossil hunters on a beach in southwest England. Not only were they looking for fossils in a protected area, they were doing so with a rock saw and an angle grinder. So are all these amateur fossil hunters a good thing? Lizzie thinks that there's no problem, as long as everyone follows the rules and stays safe. And what's more, more searching also save specimens that would otherwise be lost to sea. Back in 2017, Lizzie discovered a prehistoric crocodile that was previously unknown to science. Absolutely no cliff climbing required. The Economist So around 6pm Lebanon and Israel time on Thursday evening, as Hassan Astrala, Secretary General of his Barra the Shia movement, which basically controls Lebanon, was delivering his televised speech to his membership. Israel began carrying out a large series of airstrikes of hisbola missile launch pads in Lebanon, mainly southern Lebanon and also partly the Becker Valley. From what we've heard from Israeli military officials, they hit over a hundred of those launch areas. And this is probably the largest airstrikes that we've seen in the 11 months war between Israel and hisbola. Well, the expectation was that a military operation would happen immediately after these pages, and then the walkie-talkie explosions because they created so much chaos in the hisbola ranks, that that would have been the ideal moment to open a military offensive. And instead, it took a couple of days. So I think what we're seeing here is more series of stages of escalation in between which Israel is putting out messages direct or indirect to hisbola to see if there's any chance that they are going to commit to some kind of a ceasefire and not a ceasefire connected to the other ceasefire which has been under discussion and terminal rounds of negotiations in Gaza. So this was basically Nasrallah's message on Thursday evening. The Omnitsuleta and Omnibah. The Omnitsuleta. He admitted the accept the fact that his movement had taken a hit in these explosions, he obviously blamed Israel for it. But he also said that we are not going to stop attacking Israel as long as the war is happening also in Gaza. So so far at least on an official level Israel's attempt to decouple these two fronts, the Gaza front and the hisbola front, has an yield of anything. But from these ready officials I'm hearing they didn't expect the strait to suddenly accept a ceasefire. This was a speech that they were expecting and therefore these further stages of escalation were already in place. Well so very good question. We know that hisbola has tens of thousands of highly trained fighters over 100,000 missiles. Basically hisbola even though it's not a state organization has at its disposal an army that rivals that have many states. But at the same time following these explosions of the pages in the walkie talkies, thousands of its members probably quite important commanders have been hospitalized. Their communication networks have been totally disrupted. So they are at a tactical disadvantage at this moment. So the next stage would be one of two things. Either further air strikes perhaps deeper in Lebanese territory, taking out more of hisbola's missile arsenal. And the other option of course is a ground offensive and the Israeli army is already said that they've deployed a second division up north near the border with Lebanon which will be training over the weekend. That would indicate that there is a plan to go in on the ground to occupy a buffer zone security area of a few kilometers at least, which will prevent short range missile strikes by hisbola on Israeli communities near the border. Now as far as I know the decision to launch such an offensive hasn't been taken and the troops and the tanks are not yet in place for that. But that is certainly the next ratcheting up on the escalation scale. Well it looks like Israel's leaving space of a day or two between these stages for diplomacy, for the Americans and for other mediators to speak to Lebanese government, to speak to hisbola and see if there is any indication of hisbola being prepared to end this campaign, which has been going on for over 11 months of firing at Israel. For most of the past 11 months, the idea that most people had was that there would be a cease firing Gaza which would lead to a ceasefire also in Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Now with the prospects of a cease firing Gaza seeming very dim, this is an Israeli attempt to try and divide these two issues and push hisbola to agree to a ceasefire, even though the war in Gaza continues. I'm looking forward to that rosy. In the heats of humidity, that's eventually overwhelmed him. Sick on court several times. One player is going to die and they will see. And he's talking about the authorities and it's a continuation of the discussion that we've been having in this set. He's sending a very strong statement to him. Heat has a really strong impact on athletic performance and actually on athlete's health. And as the world is warming, that is making sports events more dangerous and more difficult to hold. And yet simultaneously you're also seeing a big expansion in the areas where big sports events are being held. And these two things are definitely in conflict with one another. It can make a really significant difference. So there was a study that was conducted around the 2019 World Athletics Championships, which were held in Doha, which is very hot and very humid. And they were measuring how the athletes performed in endurance events compared with their own personal best. And they found that almost all of the athletes that they studied overwhelmingly did worse than their personal bests. And it was between three to 20% worse. And the degree to which they underperformed was they thought correlated with how hot and how humid it was outside. And you know, getting up to 20% reduction in performance is really, really significant. And I also think that it should be noted that this was going on despite the fact that the organizers of that event had already taken some pretty severe measures to try and mitigate against the heat and humidity that you would have holding an event like this somewhere like Doha. So the women's marathon, the start time was 11.59 p.m. So you know, they're running in the middle of the night. All the events that could possibly be in a gigantic air conditioned stadium were. And so even with that, you're seeing a really, really significant level of performance reduction. So if you want the really geeky answer, this is a classic thermodynamics thing, which is that your body is converting energy sources like you get from food into kinetic energy. All of those processes create waste heat. And so when it is very hot outside, not only is your body trying to regulate its temperature against the ambient temperature is also having to then fight against the fact that it is generating more heat internally. There's also a lot of things that your body will do to try and call you down, which make activities feel more strenuous. For example, your body will be sending blood to your skin because that's how heat moves towards the surface. And that means that you are not getting as much blood sent to your muscles, which you need. You are going to be sweating more, which means you're going to be getting dehydrated more quickly, all of which is going to have an impact on performance. But in the case of sport in particular, one of the really, really dangerous scenarios is the thing called exertional heat stroke, which is basically when your body is generating too much heat that it cannot do. And that can start with symptoms like confusion and evolve into very, very serious symptoms like organ failure and ultimately death. It is thought to be one of the third leading causes of sudden death amongst young American athletes. The hospitalised case is the fertility rate is around 15%. But if untreated, it's thought to be up to 80%. So this is obviously very important to do. And I think that it should also be noted that these problems do not only arise when you are holding an event somewhere like Doha. This summer, Paris had the Olympics. Temperatures there are about three degrees on average higher in August than they were last time that Paris had the Olympics in 1924. So you know, probably the most important thing and this is starting to happen is understanding when conditions just are too dangerous for certain events to be played. And you have seen a trend in recent years of international federations starting to set guidelines around their own specific sport. The United States tennis association, for example, will suspend play when the combined heat and humidity gets to a too high threshold, which you know is a good precaution to take. Although the threshold that they set for that does still seem to be very high is significantly above the threshold that was recommended by places like the American College of Sports Medicine. So there are certain amounts still needs to be done on finessing these guidelines to the fact that these are very, very strontious activities, often which run for hours at a time. Possibly yes, and you are seeing actually a growing number of athletes are starting to speak out about the fact that they fear that having to compete in extremely high temperatures is going to be very damaging for them. I think the other thing that you have to remember is that very, very highly paid athletes are actually quite rare. Most working athletes, even if they are competing at Olympic levels, they have to do a lot of sponsorship to make money. So the numbers of athletes that we are seeing now saying, you know, I feel like this is dangerous, I feel like this is a threat to my life. This is congestion, I am guessing, but I would expect is less than the actual total number who feel something like this because it is a hard thing to do, particularly if you are up and coming or from a smallest water, whatever that doesn't get as much public attention. When Francisco Lopera was a boy, he used to dream about flying saucers and think that he would be an astronomer because all the great mysteries lay out in the cosmos. That idea faded when he began to get more interested in medicine and it disappeared completely when he went to visit his grandmother with his father, one day when he was in his first year at medical college. The grandmother was sitting simply staring blankly at them and she didn't recognize either of them when they came in and it made his father cry, his own mother didn't know him. And from that point, Francisco made a pledge that he wouldn't let that happen to anyone's granny if he became a doctor. He kept that pledge and it took every ounce of his considerable energy to keep it because the Alzheimer's that his grandmother suffered from was incurable. He knew very well that hundreds of drugs had been tried to cure it and not one had worked. It was a slide disease because it built up for years, it was asymptomatic perhaps for 30 years and then people would start forgetting things and then they'd forget how to work and eventually they'd forget who they were in the final horrible stages of the disease. There were many myths in his native Columbia about how Alzheimer's was caught. People thought you perhaps had to touch the bark of a certain tree or be contaminated by the blood of an Alzheimer's victim. Some even said that it was the result of a curse that had been put on various parts of the country by priests or statues, all sorts of tales. And they were particularly rife in the northern part of Columbia which Francisco Lopera actually came from called Antioquia. That was a very poor mountainous district and main city was Medellin which in those days had a terrible reputation being the murder capital of the world. It was a region that was locked in conflict between Marxist gorillas and right-wing paramilitaries for much of the time that he was working there. But he was still interested in trying to pursue why there was such a high prevalence of Alzheimer's there because strangely there was. And it all came into focus in 1982 when a 47-year-old man was brought to see him. It was clearly Alzheimer's but he was very young to have it and it turned out that his father had had Alzheimer's to and his grandfather and several of his aunts. And that was extremely interesting because it meant that here was possibly a whole population of families who were related to each other and all to some degree carriers of the disease. And what he had to do he saw quite clearly was to go out into the villages which were very remote and foraged through the records, the parish roles, the birth certificates and death certificates. To find out who was related to whom and try to draw up a great big genealogical chart of the families in the whole region. He found that it was really very common for most of them to die in their 40s or 50s. This was early on set Alzheimer's and it was terrifying to the carriers because when they were younger they could not imagine what they would do if they caught this disease and they lived in dread of going down with it because of course they had relations with it. The other thing he had to ask them for was to let him have the brains of those who'd recently died from Alzheimer's in fact to let him have those brains as soon as possible and this they found extremely difficult. So from the brains that he began to discover what the mutation was that had given them this tendency. He found there was a single mutation on chromosome 14 and that single mutation had gone down the generations and it seemed in the end if it carried on with no preventive measures that perhaps half the people in the region. And certainly half the people among those 6000 families would come down with early on set Alzheimer's. He was asked seeing that Akira was obviously some way of what could be done to mitigate the terror of Alzheimer's which now has quite a grip on the world as people get older they fear it more and more. He said that it shouldn't be seen as a tragedy to him although it was a very serious disease. There were ways of dealing with it if you could manage to instill an atmosphere of happiness and support around it. In fact he said Alzheimer's really should be looked on as a new form of life. But first… I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris. When I was press secretary, I got skewered for never holding a White House briefing. It's because unlike my boss, I never wanted to stand at that podium in lie. So let's get the hard part out of the way. I am a Republican. But tonight I stand here as an American. An American that cares more about the future of this country than the future of Donald Trump. Four years ago, never Trump conservatives helped Joe Biden win. Thousands of Americans who voted for Trump in 2016, then abandoned him in 2020, particularly a White call, tentative voters in the suburbs. But this time around, it's not so clear what kind of impact they'll have. So initially when the group was founded in 2015, 2016, around the time that Trump was campaigning for the first time, never-Trumpers were the Republicans, true conservatives, who believed that Trump was not the right candidate, and they would never vote for Trump. Now it's sort of changed because there are a lot of people who self-identify as never-Trumpers or part of an never-Trump camp who were initially on the Trump-Fan-Douagen and have now decided that he poses a unique threat to democracy. Some are political strategists and operatives who have worked in Republican politics for many years. You might remember groups like the Lincoln Project, a conservative political action committee that got lots of attention for viral ads that just pissed off Trump and got him to say angry things on social media about them. Donald, it's just not working. You know it. The country is laughing at you. Eating pets? Really, Donald? That's all you got. Others are politicians who were in office and maybe are not now or some still are and have decided that they don't want to go along with the MAGA movement. Big names here include people like Mitt Romney in the Senate, Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia, and Liz Cheney, who was ousted from her Congressional post in Wyoming in 2022. It's not clear, but they're absolutely trying. A group called Republican voters against Trump is planning to spend $40 million in ads this cycle in swing states. What they're doing is they have former Republican voters who are just saying on air why they're not voted for Trump again and why other Republicans shouldn't either. The Lincoln Project is also spending big and hoping that they can flip two specific voter blocks right before the election. These are the red-done conservatives who are old school Republicans who grew up in the Reagan era who are uncomfortable with Trump's coziness with Russia and Dodd's dad's Millennial fathers who are having a hard time explaining abortion bands to their daughters. So Rosie, it's interesting. The movement is actually divided on that question. People say that although Trump is a threat to democracy, Republicans shouldn't be compromising their conservative values and advocating for their constituents to vote for Conley Harris who really doesn't represent them. For example, Pat Tumey, who's a former senator from Pennsylvania and let's just remember that Pennsylvania is probably the most consequential state in this election. He was on a show called Squawk Box on CNBC on September 3rd and he told Joe Kernen who's a host on that network that he would vote for neither Trump nor Harris. You would prefer high knowledge that the outcome is a binary situation but my choice is not. Okay. On the other hand, there's a camp within the Nevertron movement that's perhaps bigger that really thinks that this position is dangerous and that Nevertronpers should absolutely vote for Harris. But even within the movement, there's so much pessimism about changing minds. Charlie Sykes, a former conservative talk show host in Wisconsin, that's another important swing state. It says Nevertronp is a movement of leaders without followers. It does seem so. If we look at economists you got polling since 2016, the percentage of Republicans who planned to vote for Trump actually rose from 80% to 90% and swing voters that share of Republican leaning independence who planned to back him overall hasn't really budged since 2020. That means that these voices are not actually catching on. I'm back. Why is there so little movement? There are a couple possible reasons. The first is that there are Republicans most aligned with the Nevertronpers. The more traditionalist George Bush Republicans, Neo conservatives, they've probably already left the party and the voters who have held on, the people who are still in the Republican party, are probably less influenced by the elite old timers like the Channies. So Rosie, one thing that really came to light while reporting this story is that despite all of these important people getting up and saying things that are quite controversial, the most persuadable voters are in fact the ones who are paying the least attention. So no matter how many campaign ads they're being bombarded with and how many veteran politicians come out against Trump, they probably won't be listening. The Chinese government has decided to raise its retirement age for the first time in decades. And this is a response to a severe ageing population crisis in that country. People over 60 already make up more than a fifth of its population and that is likely going to get worse. That is triggering a massive problem for its pension system by some estimates the country's basic pension fund will run out by 2035. Given those problems raising the mandatory time and age, which are some of the lowest in the world has become absolutely necessary. But that risk creating a whole host of newer problems and one of the most notable ones is in childcare. China doesn't provide a lot of publicly funded childcare. In fact, most Chinese families rely on their grandparents to take care of toddlers and infants. According to state media, a fewer than 8% of Chinese toddlers are actually enrolled in nurseries. And so you can see how grandparents play such a huge role. In fact, some research suggests that in many cities up to 80% of households rely on grandparents. That's right, because having grandparents take care of the children is so important. So keeping them in the workforce for three to five years longer will probably force women to wait to have children or just not have them at all. China's fertility rate is 1.1, which means very few women have more than one child. And that's one of the lowest in the world. It's well below the 2.1 rate that's required to keep populations stable. And because China has very few immigrants, it can rely on that to boost its fertility rate. According to studies published last year, women who rely on grandparents for child care are four times more likely to have a second kid than women who do not have that support. Essentially, without grandparents around, you face a situation of, I don't want a second kid. I don't want to have children that would actually be necessary to boost the fertility rate or just delaying much later when the grandparents are retiring, in which case, some women might by then might not be able to have children. Historically, China had a pre-robust, for its time, publicly funded child care system. Now, that's basically been curtailed since the 1980s and 1990s when China liberalized its economy. And much of the welfare state has been privatized. And because the retirement age is so low, having grandparents take care of children was just simply the most economical solution for a lot of households. So with the retirement age reforms, a lot of families are scrambling to think of an alternative. There is no indication that they will do anything. But the risks are really mounting. Essentials we're seeing here is almost a circular problem, right? So raising a retirement age was partially meant to increase the population and labor force. Because obviously a shrinking workforce will be very bad for China's economy, which is already facing a severe slowdown. But with newer reforms, and since you were giving lots of Chinese women a very difficult choice to make here, either you'd probably deepen the fertility races because mothers just won't give birth anymore or you're worse than a labor force crisis because a lot of mothers would have to ditch work and do child care themselves. And that seems to be a rising problem and the government is starting to recognize it. But the pension crisis almost trumps all these concerns out at this point. And so they're really just focusing on tackling that. And so these underlying crisis that will emerge over time. One of the demographics that's most unhappy about this change is young people. Young people have been voicing their discontent with the government and with these policy changes on social media. It's so difficult to find a job now for a lot of younger people. The labor market is very tight. For some of these younger people, they think that the new policy will keep older workers in the workforce longer. And that will make it harder for younger workers to enter the labor market. And that's probably not true because making people work for longer could encourage them to consume more. It could boost the economy. It could create jobs. But when enough people believe that this is the case, that if you have older people around, they will lose out. This perception itself is worrying off the government. And so there are netizens, for example, that call on the experts recommended. The retirement age reforms to die. And sensors have already moved in to remove some of these comments. The Chinese government, which is stability obsessed, saw what happened when a lot of people are very discontent about pension reforms, as you saw in France last year. And so those kinds of backlash and those kinds of sustained protests, it's hard enough for a liberal democracy. It would be the stuff of nightmares for China. Thanks, Rosy. Thanks for having me on. People are spending money on all kinds of things for their pets. On Airbnb nowadays, the Bookings website, you can see people splashing out on mansions that come with pet friendly ponds and blankets, especially for dogs. I've spoken to pet food companies that show off about how their dishes are taste tested by human beings. One of these companies called Butternut Box has a favorite dish, a chicken dish, that is made with just a whiff of sage. One of my favorite brands is called Dog by Leesets, an Australian brand started by a vet, and she sells all kinds of clones and bombs, specifically for dogs. I asked her to dogs really need to be moisturized, and she says it's just like humans, and she said to me, would you wash your face and not moisturize afterwards? It really seems like there's very little that people wouldn't do for their pets nowadays. So just last year, people spent $186 billion in America on their pets. And this is not just products, it's not just things like moisturizers. That includes everything from vet bills, to insurance, to food and treats and grooming products. The thing is, at the moment in the consumer world, you have a massive crunch. You've got high inflation, people are worried about their jobs, they're cutting back, spending on themselves. And yet the amount that people plan to spend on their pets is going up and up. I spoke to some analysts at Morgan Stanley, and they reckon it's going to go up to 261 billion by 2030. So a cost of living crisis is not going to affect this industry. There's two dynamics here. One is just to do with pet ownership. So during the pandemic, when everyone was locked down, the idea of having a dog or a cat seemed quite nice. It wasn't much of a hassle to take a dog for a walk when the world was shut down. It wasn't a hassle to be home to feed the cat when there was nowhere to go. So lots of people adopted pets at that time. So you had a slight jump in pet ownership. At the same time, people are just spending more per pet. There's this real change in how people think of the animals and their homes. The saying is the dog has gone from the garden to the front room to the bedroom to actually being on your bed. People consider themselves the pets parent. And of course, when you think of something as your child, as your offspring, you're probably going to spend more on it. In particular, young pet owners, who make up a larger share of pet ownership in general, they're really willing to splash out on the animals. So in particular, millennials are now the biggest demographic of pet owners. A lot of millennials have put off getting married and having babies and they're getting pets instead. Gen Z's not far behind. Gen Z is now leaving their parents home, finishing studies, and a lot of them are getting pets as well. From all kinds of research, you can see that younger pet owners are willing to spend more. Surveys show that they take their animals to the vet more often. They're also spending more on things like gifts at Christmas or birthdays for their pets. So they're really spoiling these animals and they are, in some cases, adopting them in place of having their own children. They are indeed, so I've mentioned to you some startups doing high-end products, vegan, grooming products, GMO-free grooming products. But actually, what's really surprised me in reporting the story is how a lot of the big consumer groups I think about, they're actually pet companies. So take Mars. You probably think of Mars as producing those caloric, chewy chocolate bars. But actually, two thirds of Mars's turnover last year came from the pet's division. They produce pet food, but they also have loads of veterinary clinics. It's the same for Nestle, it's the same for Colgate. You have these really big consumer groups that you might not realise it, but they're actually pet businesses. And they're growing very fast. You're seeing lots of other companies trying to get into the business of pets. You've actually got so much private equity money going into the veterinary sector that there's antitrust concerns. They've bought up so many vet clinics. You've had consolidation. Both in Britain and in America, you've got regulators worried about that. Honestly, Jason, I don't have a pet. And then reporting the story, I've been flabbergasted. I can't imagine what the limit will be. In my research, I found people who have private jets kitted out just so their pet can be comfortable on board. So it seems like there's really nothing they wouldn't do for the animals. Thanks for having me, Jason. It's inefficient. Recently I visited ESML which is a giant Dutch company that makes tools. Now to be able to see this tool first and foremost, I need to wear the bunny uniform that is completely covered in white. My face is in a mask and I have to go through multiple air purifying blasts. This is blown from your bunny suit before you enter a declin room. Now past that point we walk through essentially this really sterile environment and then we approach what looks like a giant warehouse. When the doors of the giant warehouse open, you are in presence of this massive steel machine. This is the high NA EUV system. This is the latest and greatest or most modern system that we ship. These machines cost upwards of $350 million. It's unlike anything I've seen before. Now you would expect something as big as a double decabus and weighing over 100 tons to be a very noisy machine. But in effect when you actually enter the giant cavernous room that holds these machines, you won't hear too much of a noise. This is kind of a low frequency humming. But rather than coming from the machines, it's actually coming from all the cooling engines that go to keep this machine stable. the laws of physics. The machine fires 50,000 droplets of tin into a vacuum chamber every second. There's a laser that heats up each drop to almost 220,000 degrees Celsius which is 40 times hotter than the surface of the sun. This heat then essentially melts the droplets into plasma and in the process it emits light of extremely short wavelength. This narrow beam of light gets reflected using a very intricate system of mirrors. It then is projected onto a wafer that is coated with a tiny layer of photoresist such that the imprint of the circuit gets etched onto the So the big thing about making chips faster is you need to make transistors smaller. And what struck me was these machines have just become bigger and bigger and bigger as the chips that they make get smaller and smaller and smaller. It's almost the inverse. To make the smallest chip you need almost the giant machine. The challenge is how do you continue to etch patterns in tens of nanometers and continue to go smaller and smaller and smaller. journalistic interest, aren't they? That's right. So almost 20 years ago, I was a chip designer myself and to give listeners a sense of my age, the technology that I was working on at that point was what was known as 350 nanometers and what is state of the art these days is around five nanometers. That's right and I think that is one of the exciting things about this field is every year, the technology changes and with it as an engineer you need to adapt and so you're constantly learning, you're constantly evolving and that's what makes it pretty exciting. So you described you were you were doing it? I think some parts were largely the same, which is the entire process of making a chip is a fairly long one. It can take anywhere between 12 to 18 months by the time you start designing a chip to the time it actually makes it out of the factory which is known as a fab. And the chip itself is a very intricate structure that can have multiple layers which are of course not visible to the naked eye but can have between 10 to 15 layers on them. So that part has largely stayed the same. What has changed is everything within a chip has become that much more tiny, it has become that much more complex and the ability to keep shrinking the transistor has become electronic device you use, the refrigerators, the sensors, anywhere you look it will have a tiny processor inside. Now the scale of the processor could vary but the underlying structure is similar in the sense that the basic unit is something called a transistor which is nothing but a glorified switch. And when the transistor is on, it's a one and when the transistor is off, it's zero. And the entire computer programming language is nothing but a series of ones and zeros. So you can think of processors as just these giant engines that keep switching between ones and zeros based on the program that it is fed in. And of course based on the complexity of the processor, the complexity of the underlying chip changes. Now each processor itself can have multiple components. So first is the processing itself which is the transistors that are computer. The computer is happening. Whether the computer is happening. The second part is what is known as the control. So think of control almost like the traffic signal. It tells the program or the data coming in where it must go. It actually coordinates what's happening on the processor. And the last part is what is known as a memory. And memory is where you actually store pieces of information that fundamental innovation that has made that happen? Fundamentally everything goes down to what is known as Moore's Law. Now this was a law that was coined at the time it was not really a law. It was more of an observation that was coined by Gordon Moore who was one of the co-founders of Intel, the giant American chip company. And what he observed was that computing power would essentially double every few years. But the cost of the processor would largely remain the same. So that is a very fundamental ten end to everything that we see in chips. So in effect you are essentially getting more processing power for the same cost. And that happens because as you start shrinking a transistor you start getting all kinds of good side effects so to speak. It switches much faster which means the processing speed is higher. It consumes less power so you are able to pack a lot more of these transistors onto a single chip. It is fundamentally shrinking the transistor that has enabled long looking at them. What is it that's changed? So that's right. So one of the things we used to always joke about when I was a chip designer is if only people knew how complex this thing that we do, they'd maybe appreciate us more. So we're appreciating it now. I guess 20 years to late but still it's welcome. But you're right at that point in time a lot of the focus was on the applications that were running on the processor itself. Part of the reason I think is because the semiconductor industry was so successful that people didn't actually notice it. So because it was most successful software engineers almost assumed that with every successful generation the processor is going to become faster. So you can design your algorithms without worrying too much about the kind of hardware that underlines it. But more slaw which we just mentioned has slowed down some would argue that it's dead and kind of the same gains are no longer possible. And once that has happened software engineers can no longer be disconnected from the hardware that their programs run on. To get a sense of this I spoke to Eric Popp who's an electrical engineer and a material scientist at Stanford University and pretty knowledgeable about Moore's law and some of the new materials that are there after silicon. Eric told us about how much transistors has shrunk. The transistors were several microns in the 1970s. The diameter of a human hair is about 50 microns. They have shrunk to about one micron by the 1980s and about a quarter micron in 1990s. And finally in around the turn of the millennium they became less than 0.1 microns or just about 100 nanometers about the size of a virus. And of course they've gotten almost 10 times smaller since then. So you can imagine how small these things have gotten today. And you can imagine that the smaller you make these transistors the faster they get because electrons which carry the charge in these things just have the smaller distances to travel. But miniaturization isn't just about transistors. The entire chips have shrunk and Eric explained how that's brought about its own set of challenges. The spacing between transistors has also shrunk at the same time. And so have the metal wires that are actually wiring these things up on the chip. You can imagine that having more transistors per chip is always going to be better because you can store more data and you can just do more things. People who are writing software simply have more transistors to work with and so they can just write much more complex software. But if you put billions of these things on a chip and many of them are switching you can imagine that the energy consumption has also got up. Around 20 years ago about 2005 computer chips were already using about 100 watts. That's the power of a bright incandescent light bulb in the area of about a postage stamp. So you can imagine the temperatures they could reach if we could not cool them properly. And so what we do right now is we have chips with very different power levels. We have extremely power hungry chips which are water cooled and those are in servers and in data centers. And we also have very low power chips which deliberately work at fractions of a watt. And many of these of course are in our mobile phones where battery life is very important. for the semiconductor industry, for the AI model makers and the amount of energy used by these processes is non-trivial. And to give you a sense of the scale think about it this way. One new blackwell chip which is Nvidia's latest GPU and it's the top of the line GPU. Over a year it will use about half the energy of an average American household. So I like one of the phrases that an executive from the semiconductor industry told me which is there is no one silver bullet anymore. It's a sum of a lot of small things. One of those ideas for instance is what is known as backside power delivery. And if you think about backside power delivery traditionally in a chip the power lines which supply electricity to all the chip are typically on the top of the chip and these are really thick metal lines that then borrow from the top all the way down. And typically they would take anywhere between a fifth to almost a quarter of the chips area because they are just so thick as compared to rest of the metal lines. Intel and TSMC which is Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company which is essentially the company that makes the chips for Nvidia your Apple iPhones all leading at chips are made in TSMC. They are now working on something called backside power delivery where they use the lower part of the chip which is typically not being used and move the power lines from the top to below. And what this does is it frees up the area on top of the chip to be able to route more lines. And essentially by doing this you are able to reduce the power consumption because the power lines have to travel a lot shorter distances which means they burn less energy in getting than that. That's true. And I think everything in semiconductors as you get into it the manufacturing even a tiny change is not simple. And in this particular case it requires a change in the manufacturing process in how the chip is actually built. Yeah okay so energy efficiency is a big become even better? Well they range from starting to think about materials beyond silicon which has been the workhorse of the semiconductor industry for so long as well as more innovative structures where you actually stack materials and transistors one on top of each other. And Eric Pop actually told me about these in more detail. Reducing the distances between computing and memory meaning where the data is actually processed and the data is actually stored remains a fundamental challenge. Probably the best bet we have is actually stacking chips in 3D. So stacking things vertically essentially building what I would call something like high rise chips where various layers of logic and memory are interleaved and the distances between them are extremely short. This might actually also have the advantage that we will no longer have to reduce the size of the transistors much more after we do this because if we shrink the distances between transistors or if we shrink the distances between transistors and memory vertically we are likely to make things much quicker and more energy efficient at the same time simply because the electrons and the current doesn't have to travel as long as it might have to if it were to travel laterally. before right? Exactly it's definitely not an easy process. Today when a semiconductor chip is made it is made like a pizza almost in different layers you start at the base and you start layering in different chemical components to make up the layers. Now one of the challenges with the 3D stacking approaches you're essentially stacking transistors on top of each other and in manufacturing when you start to make the transistors they are manufactured by heating them to a thousand degrees or even more and how do you stack multiple transistors on each other without melting the wires becomes a big challenge and that's one of the reasons why looking at new materials beyond silicon which potentially have a lower temperature to make that becomes quite interesting. This is fascinating quite promising. One of them is called two-dimensional materials and they're called two-dimensional not because they're actually in 2D but because the thickness is so small that for all products. Atom thick. Atom thick that for all practical purposes they're 2D. That's one class of material. The other class of material is called one-dimensional because as you can see, you can work in few. What is that? One-dimensional essentially carbon nanotubes that you can think about a cylinder of carbon and it's literally as simple as that and as small as that. materials? Well, Eric Pop is one of the people who's actually working on this area and his specialty is two-dimensional semiconductor materials. He told me how he's thinking about the future of this field. Both academic research labs as well as industry research labs today are trying to improve the quality and the uniformity of two-dimensional semiconductors. They need to have fewer defects. In comparison, silicon today is essentially defect-free. There are even fundamental challenges related to these materials that exist today. For instance, we don't necessarily know what some of their most basic thermal and electrical properties are because they're just not as well known as silicon. Silicon is just one material but two-d semiconductors are really a family of materials. They could be dozens or maybe even more than a few dozen materials. So it's not entirely clear which ones of these are best suited to perhaps replace or to complement silicon. There are some scientific issues to be worked out, of course, but fundamentally, I think the question will be, can we do this at sufficiently low cost? Shalej, I want to move on to talk about the actual conventional computer algorithms? So most deep learning algorithms are nothing but a series of networks which crunch through a lot of data and the most important thing about deep learning algorithms is the fact that they do a lot of this in parallel. So nothing happens sequentially, most of their processing happens in parallel and that is essentially the key point when thinking about computer architecture for these type of algorithms. And to get a better sense of this, I spoke with Dave Paterson, who's a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and an advisor to Google Architecture. He also won the prestigious Turing Award for his work and has written one of the and abbreviations that are a lot more their TPU and PU, I wanted to kind of focus a little bit on Google's TPU, which I know you were involved with. Can you explain how that was different or what was the problem with just trying to solve that was not being solved by Nvidia GPU, for instance? neural networks. In your opinion, what is the impact on performance if that is the criteria? economical. You mentioned Google, but right now it's I would say all of the big tech artists in requirements for the ongoing use of those models? So a lot of the excitement so far has been focused on the training of these models. And when we train these models, they are run on data centers and the type of chips that we just talked about, which is GPU, CPUs and the like. But when you're running these models on your phone, for instance, they need to be able to first and foremost use very little power and then respond to your query much more quickly. And that is what is known as inference when you're using AI applications. And the kind of computer architecture that you need to design chips that are able to infer a lot more quickly is slightly different from what we've been talking about for training. And Apple, for instance, in its most recently released iPhone, they talked about this neural processing unit, NPU, which is situated in their main processor that is actually optimized for running AI applications on a mobile device. Okay, it sounds like software companies then are We are entering an era where it's no longer just a central processing unit. We now have a situation where multiple companies are looking at many different architectures based on the type of application Absolutely. So, so far, our conversation has been focused a lot on the hardware. But equally important has been the gains in software. So software has not been static. And the benefit of software is it can change at a much quicker pace than hardware. Remember, we talked about how hardware may take 12 to 18 months to come out with a new processor. Well, software, you can actually come out with iterations literally every four to six months. And that has also been kind of improving at a very rapid pace. One way is to actually use less precise numbers when doing these computations. So, remember when you talked about deep learning algorithms being giant neural networks? Well, it turns out that instead of going through the entire computation every time, if you can actually identify and pair down the network, that actually speeds up the processing. The other area where you can actually optimize software performance is by reducing the precision of a lot of your number representation. A lot of the numbers in the neural networks are typically centered around 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, really small numbers, you don't really need a floating point 32-bit representation to actually represent those numbers. And so, if you can get it down to floating point 8 or maybe even 4, you're actually going to half or proportionally reduce both the power consumption as well as the know exactly when to do that and when not to do that. Sometimes the approximation can be a bad idea. that's going on in the field? He's used the term a golden age of computer architecture, which I think is really true. We're seeing an explosion in the types of different architectures, different approaches that companies are taking. For researchers, it's very exciting, but if you're the boss of a chip company, it can be pretty terrifying. Dave told me actually what he's affair now. America has been worried for some time that cutting edge chips are not being made on its soil. Most of them being made in Taiwan instead. And so its commerce secretary for instance has touted Intel as a national champion and Intel is a big recipient of America's subsidies. And America has also tried to stop China from getting access to cutting edge chips. So these are some of Nvidia's chips. But confronted with these limits on chip availability, researchers in China are sort of being very clever about how they design their models and how they respond to those shortages in sort of innovative ways. Well, Shilesh, you've been reporting on exactly that. I mean, ideas you come across there? Yes, so there are a couple of different ones. One of them is what is known as mixture of experts, which is this notion that when you're running large language models, you don't need to run the entire network. You can actually allocate the particular problem to a particular quote unquote expert, which is another network that is most suited to running that problem. And so if you can allocate tasks cleverly and with the right method, instead of running the entire network, now you're running a much smaller network. And so what that means is the amount of processing power, the amount of computation time you need is that much less. So that's one approach. The other is actually moving away from this notion of large language models and then embracing what is known as small language models, which don't need as many parameters for certain applications, particularly on smartphones and devices, they may be a lot better suited and that's where a lot of So they could be useful everywhere and it's also being tried in the West as well, though in China, the sense of urgency for them is a lot bigger. So I was excited going into Nvidia. Here's a company that developed these graphics processing units initially used for video games, then for Bitcoin mining and now sort of amazingly fortuitously for the AI boom. I will say though, I did glimpse bits of the future, I think, but because it's a chip designer rather than a chip maker, it really is like any other big tech They weren't like designs posted on the walls. Not that I could see. Sadly, not that I could see, but we met some very interesting people who talked us through how they see Nvidia's chips being used to help power the future. They talked us through some demos. Nvidia, certainly when it talks about its chips, is very big on the kind of marriage between hardware and software. So it's about how the combination of the two could help their customers. And the other thing I'll mention as an aside is Jensen Huang, the boss of Nvidia, as you probably know, is a very big fan of his leather jackets. Yes, and we did meet people wearing leather jackets as well. I will see. So clearly it's becoming a bit of a company uniform. So it wouldn't be as stretched to say that Nvidia is essentially powering most of the AI revolution that we've seen since the past four or five years. And by some estimates, their graphic processor units run almost 80% of AI workloads today. So they are by far the most dominant vendor in the space in terms of enabling a lot of these I think it will play some role in that. So the limits that we wrote about were around the power requirements of training and using large language models. Training, open AI's GPT-4 model, for instance, used the same amount of energy as would have powered 5,000 American households for a year. So it's really staggering amount of electricity. And then on top of that, if you make a query of the model, so the inference cost stacks up as well. So that high cost makes the model very expensive to build, very expensive to use. And for the technology to become useful in a kind of everyday basis, those costs need to come down. Tell me what the real breakthroughs Yes. So right now there's a huge kind of race underway to try and innovate around the power constraint and the economic constraint. And so you're seeing that on the hardware side with chips, you're seeing that on the software side. Shailesh talked a little bit about what Chinese developers are doing, but you know, model makers everywhere are specializing models, for instance, or experimenting with smaller models that sort of use chips more efficiently or that are less power their business, but what was your sense? I think they definitely were optimistic about it, but the future might be less generous to Nvidia OpenAI than it might be to other model makers, because you've got this kind of frantic effort underway to try and design the most efficient and economically useful model. The future is feels quite uncertain. I came away from Silicon Valley thinking that the field was a bit wider open than I had thought going into it, because the kind of big model makers, when you look at their performance, they're quite clustered together actually, and so it could be any one of them that lands on that ingenious idea that will give them the edge over the others. The big tech firms, for instance, are doing quite a lot as well, and more and more of them are designing their own chips. Many of them own the devices through which companies and consumers might interact with AI on a daily basis, but again, the competition between them is really fierce, but I came away thinking there's definitely a recognition of the problem and a desire to get around of chip making look like from your point of view? So I think Moorslaw is dead, though as Rachina pointed out, the innovation is definitely happening. So there's a lot of other things that are going on beyond Moorslaw now. We talked about hardware, software, specialisation, we talked about the fact that you have many different architectures that are evolving. So I think in all these areas, you've moved away from the single trick of shrinking the transistor to now trying many different ideas. We don't know which of them are actually going to be successful, but that's fine. And as kind of an old chip designer, I think it's somehow satisfying that Silicon is returning to Silicon Valley, and chip designers are finally getting their due after a lot of the coders and software engineers getting all the glory. So I like doing that. Well that's a very good place to end. The Economist Hello and welcome to the Intelligence from The Economist. I'm Jason Palmer. Something funny is going on with gym memberships and barbells. Well, actually something called the barbell effect. The gyms that are doing well are the cheap ones and the really, really expensive ones. I'm here in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Dahlia, which has been the center of Israel's airstrikes on Beirut in the last few weeks. It's been almost emptied of residents. Access here is very difficult, very dangerous. We're here with a very, very big group of journalists. We're having a look in this neighborhood which has become the center of Israel's air campaign in Lebanon. Gareth Brown writes about Lebanon from Beirut. We've had weeks of heavy airstrikes on the south of Lebanon and on the capital. Israel launched a small invasion of ground troops over the border earlier this week. This ground operation, you know, it's already been quite costly for Israel. On the first day, the IDF confirmed it had lost eight soldiers. Another soldier was confirmed dead the next day. So we're now up to at least nine members of the Israeli Army killed in action. The number of dead in Lebanon is almost at 2000. So this is a dramatically intensified conflict. And just last night, there was a huge airstrike in Beirut which is believed to have taken out Hashem Safiyeh deen. Now, he's a senior, his baller official and was the rumoured favorite to take over from Nazrallah so that is rarely offensive from the air continues and from the ground continues. You know, we're seeing and hearing the war from all sorts of directions. On the street outside my house, there are many, many displaced people. People are sleeping on cardboard boxes, they're sleeping on mattresses, the sounds of airstrikes echoing in the distance. And these airstrikes, which until a few weeks ago had been quite tightly focused on certain geographical areas, certain targets, we can feel that expanding. Just the other day, there was an airstrike on a medical clinic, 500 meters away from the Prime Minister's office. These sounds, this feeling of the aerial assault has become so quotidian. And if I walk out my house now and just go to the shop, I can hear the sound of an Israeli drone buzzing ahead a few hundred meters in the sky. There's a feeling that you're always being watched, always being tracked. And with that, there also is a feeling of tension. Well, access into the Dahia is very difficult and dangerous at the minute. It's dangerous because it's being hit with airstrikes every single day. It's sort of widely regarded as a Hezbollah stronghold and it's under the Dahia were in Nazarala but was killed in that airstrike a week ago. But it's also difficult to access because Hezbollah controls the area and you have to get permission from them to go in and report and to go in without permission is very, very risky indeed. So a few days ago, Hezbollah organized a media tour of the area and it was an opportunity for us to go in and see the aftermath of some airstrikes but also to just get a sense of the atmosphere. Now it was a bit of a circus. There was probably three or four hundred journalists sort of packed into to cars driving through this. What is essentially a huge abandoned part of the city. I mean, some of the figures say 700,000 people have fled the Dahia in the last two weeks and now it's a ghost town. So we were taken to three sites. This is a southern suburbs of Beirut. Israel has been pounding this part of Beirut with airstrikes behind me. You used to be the office of Asirat which is a religious affairs TV network and it was attacked just two days ago. There's a lot of press here. It was interesting because some Hezbollah officials made some rare public appearances. For obvious reasons they're not going out in public at the minute. We were able to talk to them, talk to some residents and really get a feel for that part of town which is very, very different to downtown Beirut or West Beirut where I am. Different in what way? I think the way that Dahia is so different is here where I am in West Beirut there's a relative normality to life. But as soon as you go into the Dahia it's very tense. You feel like you're in the heart of a war zone and with that comes frustration, anger, despair, despondence, not just from Hezbollah but from the ordinary civilians, the citizens living there. They're very angry and they wanted to tell us about that anger. One man we came across on the tour likened Israel to a cancer. He couldn't haveіти. He tookpl tentar una planted And they're chanting in support of his Allah, and the Resistence. This was a tour organized by his Ballet. It was a propaganda tour, essentially. But we saw with our own eyes the destruction and the damage. We saw the craters. We saw the leveled buildings. The short answer is that nobody knows for sure. But his Ballet always prided itself on its secrecy and discipline. That was a strength of its organization. Undeniably, they have taken a hit regarding their military leadership, their command and control, the chain of command, the political leadership has been hit hard. And it seems that they've also taken a hit in terms of their ability to fire long-range or more advanced missiles at Israel. But I think the war is now changing since the ground invasion. This is a new war, essentially. And I spoke to one very senior Lebanese political official who said, that Israel is now going into his Ballet's playground. The South is where his Ballet have spent 20 years preparing for war. This is not going to be easy for the idea. And we only have to look at history, how previous ground invasions into South Lebanon have gone. Well, as one person put it to me, I think Israel risks snatching defeat from the jaws of victory here. Many people hear a very skeptical of the notion of a limited incursion or invasion, because there's always another hilltop for someone to shoot at you from. The ground war is a very different war to the aerial war, which the Israelis have undoubtedly dominated. And I spoke to one man in the Dahieh who, his Ballet had allowed onto the scene. And though he was a civilian, he spoke as though he were an unofficial spokesperson for the movement. If there was a new occupation, if Israel was to come and try to occupy parts of Lebanon, like it did in the 1980s. How would the Lebanese people react? What would be the response from Lebanon? First of all, they are dreaming. They will not occupy Lebanon. They will not occupy Lebanon. Even though if they occupy Lebanon, we will resist and will make the resistance, we will go on the resistance until we will do for them what will happen from 1982 till 2000. We defeat them and we will defeat them again. Over the years, Hassan Zerullah was famous for making these very grand speeches, but we only have to listen to the last speech he made before he was killed. And he knew his group's strength lay in luring Israel into a ground invasion. And in effect, in his last speeches, his last words were, bring it on. Perhaps he was just speaking from the experience of 2006. The last time Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon. But it seems at the moment that Israel is doing exactly what he might have wanted them to do. This ground invasion could be something of a lifeline for his baller. This has been an incredibly dramatic and deadly few weeks for Lebanon. Over a million people have been displaced from their homes, almost 2000 Lebanese. Have been killed. But now the war is entering a new phase, a new chapter this ground war is going to be very, very different. And it could determine the future not just for his baller and Lebanon, but for the whole of them at least. Thanks for having me on. So, I went to a gym called Third Space in Islington, which is in North London. A Vanticatual Coatty is the economist's global business correspondent. And it was like no gym I'd ever seen before. So, when I turned up, what I would call a reception, they actually called a concierge. Then went downstairs and there was a really nice smoothie bar. There was a gym floor, which looked like what you'd expect a gym to look like, lots of weights and machines. But the really busy part was some sort of relaxation zone. There were these big vibrating wheels that people were leaning against to apparently loosen up your muscles. There were these guns that also vibrate that people were sort of shoving into their legs and their arms. Also apparently good for your muscles. There was a huge pool, there was a cold plunge pool. And I'm told that these gyms across London have red light therapy. They have cryo chambers. They have lots of stuff that comes under this term, wellness. So, to get a club membership, you're looking at spending about £250 a month. The catch is that this Islington club is so busy that if you sign up today, you can't actually start going until February. And this is a British example, but there's premium gyms like this around the world. Equinox, which is New York based, is probably the best known. And Equinox actually launched a new membership this year that costs $40,000, which is more than the average British person makes. And so there are plenty of people who want to shell out this kind of money. Exactly. So, the global market for physical activity is worth $1 billion, according to the Global Wellness Institute. And while sectors like retail, restaurants are growing pretty slowly right now, the physical activity market, so that's gyms and sporting things, that's expected to grow at an average annual rate of just over 6% between 2023 and 2027. I mean, all of that sounds counter to the narrative. We remember from the post pandemic era when gyms were really in dire straits. Yes, it was interesting during lockdowns, sort of 2020 onwards, people were saying that the gym was dead. We'd all got used to working out at home, just a yoga mat, maybe some wine bottled or tin cans as weights. And why would anyone go back to the gym? People bought pelotons, those sort of stationary bikes that are connected to the internet. And we thought people would just be using them at home. But the truth is, almost as soon as lockdowns were lifted, people rushed back to the gym. I've got some data from a company called PASA AI. It's an analytics firm that tracks people's location. And you can just see that aside for one 12-month period, you've had a very steady increase in footfall into gyms in America in particular. And so, what happened was lockdowns were lifted, and people really were craving physical interaction. They wanted to meet other people, and the gym is a great place to do that. Probably the most obvious way to prove this happened is to look at peloton. You know, during COVID, this was the poster child for at-home fitness. The stock was going up and up and up. There was a waiting list to get a peloton bike. And to give you a sense, the market capitalisation of peloton was $50 billion in December 2020. It is since plummeted. It's less than $1.7 billion. This year, the Chief Executive had to step down. 15% of the workforce was cut, and they've been borrowing more and more. It just goes to show that it's at-home fitness trend didn't last. What did happen was that people work out differently. People are going to the gym in the middle of the work day to break it up when they're working from home. The airspace for one is opening more and more clubs in suburbs rather than in the city centres. Because if people aren't necessarily going to the office, they might like to have a gym that's close to home instead. So the pandemic definitely didn't kill gyms. It did change the industry, though. So it's not just the luxury end of things like third space that is doing all right. It's sort of across the board. It's something that the analysts call a barbell effect. So there is a consumer slowdown going on, and very rich people aren't really affected by this. So they keep pumping money into the premium gyms. At the same time, budget gyms are doing very well. They make up a growing share of the gym industry because regular middle class people no longer want to pay for that mid market gym. So now those gyms at charge maybe $20 a month, they don't have any frills. They're also doing really well. And the thing to remember is that people are going to the gym for different reasons now. There's this really interesting survey that's by MindBody, which is a company that makes software for gyms and salons and things. And they found that in 2021, most people went to the gym to control their weight. But in 2023, people said they were going to the gym to live a long and healthy life. So if the reason you're going is different, what you're looking for there is different, which explains why those premium offerings just keep doing very well. So from what you've seen is this kind of what the world of gyms will now look like, the no frills version and the super high end version and not much in the middle? Yes, so I mean, when the consumer crunch ends, I think some of this might also end. But what the gym industry looks like, what people get when they walk into a gym will just keep changing. So for example, after COVID and the consumer downtown, the next big challenge for the industry is slimming drugs. In the US in particular, more and more people are taking slimming drugs. In the gyms that I visited, people said, well, it's not like people on slimming drugs don't come to the gym. It's just that when they lose fat, they're also losing muscles. They're looking for strength exercises rather than cardio. They also said to me that young people, millennials and Gen Z, they took a lot about loneliness. So they are coming to the gym to meet people. So you'll see more and more gyms offering socials and happy hours. And just any reason that people to hang out at the gym after a class ends. I want to go thanks very much for your time. Thanks for having me, Jason. The Grandmaster sits at the pinnacle of chess. It's a rating given to someone who symbolizes someone who sort of mastered the game and all of its many intricacies. It was first used in 1838 by a publication to describe the exploits of a British player called William Lewis, who was 51 years old at that time. But nowadays the top talents are much, much younger. Every few months you get news articles saying there's been a Grandmaster that's 13 years old, 12 years old, eight year old beats a Grandmaster and so on. So this idea of a sporting prodigy is getting I'd feel in other sports less frequent. But in chess it seems to be getting more common. So I think there are two reasons. One is that there are a lot more people playing chess because it's become much easier to play chess thanks to technology. You can play chess now on apps online. And I think the pandemic accelerated that trend as more people got into chess during lockdowns when there was nothing else to do. And chess has become more popular in culture. The Greens gambit, Netflix series of our chess was quite popular. That might have helped. The second reason is that young people are particularly suited to chess because a lot of chess relies on memory or learning and memorizing moves and opening sequences and closing sequences. And younger brains are sort of more capable of doing that. That's why they say it's easier to pick up a language when you're younger and it's the same reason you're able to learn chess when you're younger. They might do. I'm sure they do. As they do in every sport. And it's an easier sport, I think, to be a pushy parent than others because it involves little cost. There's no driving to a training camp or taking your kids for practice. It just practices all done in the room on the internet and you can control it more. So perhaps that could be an explanation as well. So there's two ways to learn chess in the sense. One, obviously, is you play it. And now it's very easy for anyone to play chess against someone who's really good, be it in real life or it could be a computer. So you can play a computer that can set and you can set the level. I want to play a computer rated X and that gives you a lot of scope for development. And the other big part is I think it's easier to learn more about chess today because back in the day you'd have to read books to learn, okay, these are some of the famous openings of these are the patterns of play that you need to succeed in chess. Now you can just do that through apps and technologies and websites that allow you to learn these things very quickly. No, I don't think that's the case. If you look at the chess and Olympiad, you do see a lot of the older grandmasters still playing. It's just the case. I think a lot of it's just what's happened is there's a lot more people are playing chess. So obviously because a lot more people are playing, there'll be a lot more grandmasters. And a grandmaster basically means that you've exceeded a certain rating. And now there are more people that exceeded a certain rating. But it does not necessarily mean that you'll be guaranteed to ventrophase or have a wonderful career. So that will depend on your performance at these tournaments against other grandmasters and so on. There is a lot of young talent. There's not necessarily that all of them will flourish. But the excitement that comes with the hope of seeing these prodigies and one of them can make it and then you trace the journey through the careers that is exciting for any sports fan. And I think that's why chess fans should be excited about this golden era. Thanks for having me. I'm Rosie Blore and you're listening to The Weekend Intelligence. This week we're doing something a bit different, sharing with you two special editions of Drum Tower, our sister show about China. Michael Covrig was a Canadian diplomat when I first met him in Beijing in 2015. We chewed over various stories and I remember talking to him about how difficult it was to understand a political system that was so hard to penetrate. Unfortunately, Michael got an unparalleled insight into that system. After leaving the diplomatic corps and joining an NGO, in 2018 he was detained by the Chinese authorities and ultimately held for over a thousand days. Today, David Rene interviews Michael Covrig about that experience. It's an extraordinary story of time spent inside the Chinese Communist Party's security machine and a unique lens on Toshijim Ping's China. There's now a report that a Canadian has been detained in China. We're talking about a former diplomat for this country. We have a picture of him for you right here. His name is Michael Covrig. When it happened to me as it happened to me, I had a very acute, almost quiet-minded sense of living through my worst-case scenario. They pushed me into the SUV and just as I was disappearing into it, I looked back and I partner and I looked at each other and I just tried to send her a signal that, no, take care of yourself, take care of our baby, get help. They just shoved me to the back seat, handcuffed me, blindfolded me, officers sat on either side of me. And if you've never been handcuffed in a situation, that kind of icy, metallic feel of handcuffs closing around your wrists is a very disturbing sensation. Part of the horror of it is that it imposes on you a completely different identity. But we spend our lifetimes kind of developing a sense of who we are. Those handcuffs get slapped on you and suddenly there's an implication that you're a wrongdoer. Canada may now be caught up in the fight between China and Washington, a diplomatic dispute that could drag this country into the trade war between the two superpowers. Covrig's wife spoke to global news about the 18 agonizing months he spent behind bars. Coronavirus has taken a toll on two Canadian citizens stuck in a prison in China for the last 500 days. It has been a thousand days since Michael Spavre and Michael Covrig were detained The interrogator sitting at the desk on that day he had a single piece of paper from which he read from in a monotone voice. Four days ago, your partner gave birth to a baby girl. Mother and daughter are healthy. That's all I have for you today. He gets up and walks out and leaves me sitting in the chair for the rest of the morning, locked into it. I'm a big city guy. So I found the energy and intensity and complexity of Beijing fascinating and very energizing. One of the most useful things that I did as a diplomat in terms of trying to get to know Chinese people, I joined a couple of wine appreciation societies. I like to go a lot to little music bars and jazz bars. But that's one thing that strikes you about Beijing also for a city of its size, the sort of informal culture, the culture of the people there. Music, other performances, entertainment is really thin on the ground. But at least, yeah, in 2014 there was still a lot of fun and interesting things to do that way. It also had an interesting art scene. And I tried for diversity to try to get involved in those things, but also because those were good ways of meeting people and just immersing yourself in Chinese culture, partly because it was so hard to have meaningful conversations in official meetings. And this was in the Sunlit Twin area, which is sort of one of the most modern kind of commercial from seeing too much. Half the time if you wanted to go see Chinese contacts you wanted to talk to, you had to fight your way through Beijing traffic and cross half the city and back. So that in itself, just logistics were exhausting in the city. The others, it's a city that, you know, where everything seems to be sort of too big for a normal human scale, right? But if you've ever walked into the Ministry of Public Security, you stand in front of it and you walk into that lobby, that very building essentially says to you, you are a bug in front of the state. The state is huge and mighty. You would dream to challenge the state, you know, think again. The blocks in Beijing from an urban planning perspective are too long, right? Because everything is divided into these walled off sort of shallot you. If you're trying to get from point A to point duty. The main reason that I took the job with crisis group, the timing was, was ideal for me. When I was finishing my diplomatic posting, it became existentially clear to me that we were heading into a world where, at best, we were going to have a very intense rivalry between China and the US and its allies. And at worst, we could have a major armed conflict in the Pacific in my lifetime. And I felt that, given that there's a limited number of people who understand China and particularly also understand those kinds of issues and topics, I had a responsibility that if I could do good work in an area, even if I'm just a tiny cog in a giant system, if I can do some constructive work to try to prevent a major war in the Pacific or, you know, small things becoming big problems, I should do that work. And so the crisis group advisor position was an opportunity to do that. a calculated risk. For all of us working in China at that time, if you understood China and you were aware of the arbitrariness of the system and the law, you always lived with a certain perennial fear that something you wrote or said or did or that your government did might be misperceived somehow and you hope you might at least be able to get off lightly, you know, maybe with getting berated by the MFA or something rather than actually having the men in black come and drag you away. happening out on the ground. It's definitely not espionage, it's diplomatic reporting pure and simple. I think the issue is that the Chinese have a selective definition of espionage. And if you look at their current 2023 counter-espionage law, they've essentially criminalized asking issues in Chinese foreign policy. Some of the main issues I was looking at were things like the South China Sea disputes, tensions between China and Taiwan. And he was also interested in The main thing that I was actually drawn into working on was not in fact China, but rather North Korea. Because at that point in time, over the last couple of years, Kim Jong-un had been ramping up North Korea's missile testing and including nuclear testing, to run his tour business and he didn't speak Chinese. The point being my initial interest in him was simply like, oh, we have a Canadian living in a part of the country that is probably not the safest place to be doing business. Let's keep tabs and keep in touch with him, make sure he's doing okay. Some of Canada's allies say China could use Huawei's technology to spy on the Canadian government, even spy on us. Last week, the Pentagon banned sales of Huawei phones on American military bases around the world and FBI director Christopher Ray had this to say. We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values and provides. Huawei had rapidly become So lawmakers are concerned about Chinese companies in the US telecom sector. Huawei said in a statement that the US market presents unique challenges and it remains committed to the effort. Huawei said that privacy and security are always its first priorities. At the time I did assess that there would be consequences because the Chinese tenderly curred retaliation in such cases. I didn't expect that they would take hostages and I didn't expect they would take a meahostage in particular. First of all because the source of the dispute was really with the United States. I actually speculated that would they for example detain an American tech executive or something and thought well that wouldn't make sense. That's just going to chill the business community on China. So unfortunately I thought through some of that but I underestimated I think their rationalness and ruthlessness in prosecuting their things and also I think I didn't entirely think through adequately what China's objectives were I was in Hong Kong at the time but I had a ticket to Beijing in a few days. So again if you want to talk about sort of how human mind works right we tend to keep going with the default of what we're doing unless something pushes us to change it. I think if I hadn't had a ticket book I mentioned idealism and practicality both are important in anti-Huawei. We look up at the stats and look into the future. We also keep our feet only ground and do what we can with what is Zhou. US prosecutors say Meng used a shell company for Huawei's dealings with Iran. Misleading banks into approving millions of dollars in transactions, The Chinese side has lodged stern representations and made clear our solemn position to the Canadian and the US sides respectively on this matter. We demand that they immediately clarify the reason for the detention and release the detainee and earnestly protect the legal and legitimate rights and interests of the person involved. I actually did an interview with Al Jazeera about the Meng case on the fifth or sixth of December, just after the news broke. So I was also like many analysts scrambling to try to understand what happened and what the implications were. Trying to get information from the Canadian government about how serious is this? What are the Chinese saying to you? But nobody in the Canadian government would talk to me about it. So it was frustrating that way. apartment in the Soho complex. So I had grocery bags in my hands and we walked back through the underground passage, came up a spiral staircase onto the plaza. And I've always wondered what would have happened if I had instead walked across the main plaza rather than coming up from below. And if I had seen the fact that there were over a dozen men in black standing outside the entrance of my apartment building there. But as it was, we popped out of this spiral staircase and there they were immediately surrounding us. These men in black with cameras on their uniforms, but no markings. A woman holds up a piece of paper with Chinese writing on it that I didn't have a chance to read because everything was happening too quickly, but apparently it was a warrant for my arrest. I pulled up, I could see obviously this was not a very good situation. Pulled up my phone trying to call maybe the Canadian embassy, call anybody who was going to quickly answer to let them know that I was in a situation. They grabbed my arms, they pulled the phone away from me, they dragged my partner who was pregnant at the time away from me. So that was one of my primary concerns. Hey, what are you doing? They effectively immobilized me and then forced me to walk towards towards a waiting set of black SUVs. And when you're in a situation like that, you immediately think, it's a fight or flight instinct kicking in. There were far too many of them to even consider somehow fighting or scuffling with them. And I was also immediately mindful of the fact that really you want to get into a fight with security officers, even if you're completely innocent, you're going to be in even deeper trouble after that. So there wasn't much other option, but complying with them. So they drove off into the night. I couldn't see where we were going, but I could kind of peek around the blindfold a little bit to see the clock on the dashboard. And so I kind of keep track of time. I counted the minutes and tried to figure out where the car was turning. And based on that, I was able to reckon that we headed into South Beijing. Although I couldn't be sure because you go on these loops. We headed down the third ring road and ended up at 45 minutes later into South Beijing. I hear the gate opening. I hear a lot of dogs barking, crunch of gravel, and then I feel that we've gone down into an underground parking garage. They took me upstairs up an elevator from there and sat me in an office and took off the blindfold. And they had sat me in one of those standard interrogation chairs. It almost sort of look feels like an adult version of a child's high chair. And it's that disempowering as well. They just simply fold a board of a sort of tray over your legs and then lock it into place so that you can't get out of the chair. And the sitting at the desk was an older Chinese man maybe in his late 50s or early 60s. Very thick glasses, a translator or interpreter standing next to him and a couple of the uniformed officers there. But no badges or identifying marks. that his life had just taken. I was still hoping that maybe this was just their very aggressive way of inviting me to drink tea. Many correspondence, maybe now you personally will have been brought in at some point by the security services to have conversations about things. And my hope was this was just their way of inviting me to a conversation. But then they told me that night that you've been detained for questioning on suspicion of endangering China's national security. And at that point I knew that my worst case scenario was unfolding. Part 2 of David's interview with Michael Coverick is available now in the intelligence feed alongside this episode.

Subscribing is what makes our journalists impossible, so thank you. Search Economist Podcast Plus for a free trial. The Economist. You're listening to The Weekend Intelligence. I'm Rosie Blore and this is the second part of an interview with former Canadian diplomat Michael Covric, made by my colleagues on the DrumTow podcast. You'll find the first episode in the intelligence feed alongside this one. The story breaking right now out of China. There's now a report that a Canadian is being detained in China. We're talking about a former diplomat for this country. We have a picture of him for you right here. His name is Michael Covric. Now he no longer works for us. My hope was this was just there where inviting me to a conversation. But then they told me that night that you've been detained for questioning on suspicion of endangering China's national security. And at that point I knew that my worst case scenario was unfolding. Now we don't know if this is in response to the detection of the amount on these extra-dition charges again we're working for confirmation here. But this certainly is the kind of reprisals that some have feared what happened. Meng is a very influential woman in the People's Republic. China warned of serious consequences what form those consequences take. We do not yet know. We don't know why Michael Covric has been detained for the statement from the first few days. I was aware of Meng Wanzhou. And as a Canadian, it did cross my mind at that time that those two things might not be unconnected. But of course the interrogators that I talked to would never acknowledge that. Their narrative was always that I had done something wrong and they were there to figure out what it was that I had done wrong. I felt that by not playing along, by speaking my truth into their system, it's almost sort of like introducing a virus into a computer, right? The world's most powerful technology. The world's most powerful technology. The world's most powerful technology. They closed what was very clearly a big heavy maglock door and I'm locked into this cell with these two guards. Everything was padded, including the sink, the toilet. Patted with a vinyl coating, including the bed. It is as if this kind of vinyl coating had just sort of enveloped the world. It was so late and I was so tired I decided if I started ruminating on the situation then I could be up all night. So I actually somehow managed, I think, out of sheer exhaustion to go to sleep. They left the lights on from that time until 2021 when I finally went home. The lights were never off. Beijing is now holding two Canadians, apparently doubling the reprisals for Canada's arrest of a rich and powerful Chinese executive and multiplying the concerns for Ottawa this morning in this deepening diplomatic dispute. For Canada's wrongful detention of Miss Meng Wan Zhou, we have made clear our position, as for the cases of these two Canadian citizens, like I said, rather than authorities, China's state security authorities, are acting in accordance with laws and regulations. There's no media, no sound, nothing to do, when you're not being interrogated. You're just locked in the cell, staring at the wall. They were the political and national security enforcers of the will of that regime, and I had made the critical mistake of behaving counter to the desires of that regime. So, up to nine hours, sometimes they'll wake you up in the middle of the night to disorient you and do another round of interrogation. And that just happens, it's like, you know, nightmare groundhog day. They had three goals, essentially. First, get them to confess. So it's essentially an exercise in gas-lighting, and by which I really mean constructing a reality in which you are the bad person who has done wrong things. China is good and noble, and you have wronged the people of China, and only when you come to realize that, and you repent and apologize, and confess to crimes, and throw yourself on their mercy, and beg for forgiveness. Then maybe they might speak to the prosecutor and suggest that you could get a lighter sentence. Secondly, in my case, they were interested in who I had talked to in China. The lead interrogator said it to me at one point. We want to plug the leaks. They were trying to get me to disclose information about the Canadian government and its allies. So I very quickly had to engage in a kind of mental triage, because I had been a diplomat with top secret clearance for many years. Initially, I just didn't cooperate at all. I just kept saying, look, this is outrageous. I haven't done anything wrong. You have no right to do this. I just took a standard sort of a police procedural that I need to speak to a lawyer. I use the legal defense every time they tried to get me to admit to a crime, where I said it would always also say, look, I am not an expert in Chinese law. I can't agree with you that you say that's a crime. For the first month, I essentially didn't cooperate, so they didn't feed me. And they threatened me with never seeing my family again, never seeing daylight, possible life sentence, possible execution. They made it very clear that basically they were accusing me of espionage and threatened that it could carry a sentence of up to life or death. But if I cooperated with them, then I might be able to get that reduced down to 10 years, if I were incredibly lucky five. It's just exceedingly confining. You're locked into that chair for hours on end, so it's not torture in the sense of anybody is allowed to hit you, but it becomes excruciatingly uncomfortable, and they're very strict with you. They won't even let you cross your legs. That's considered disrespectful. They won't let you shift position. When they're interrogating you, you're almost just so relieved that another human is paying any attention to you and talking to you, that you're desperate to talk, and that's part of the whole point. They cut my rations to essentially a ball of rice gruel, and maybe a little bit of broth at each meal, or a couple of mantos deemed month. That was it. What was that doing to your health? I lost about 10 kilos in a month, but that's a short answer. And at that point, I was psychologically living day to day. I was like, I think I can get through tomorrow. So to have that sink in made me essentially recognize that I needed a new strategy for dealing with interrogation. Welcome to Dunbar. It's a quiet residential neighbourhood in Vancouver. A grey-to-story home stands out here. It belongs to Mengwanjo, the chief financial officer of Huawei. This is where she has been living since December. The home is a $5 million $3,000 square foot, 6 bedroom jail cell. It's been referred to as the Guilded Cage. So, yeah, anxiety probably runs in my family. So I'm really naturally the furthest thing from some kind of tranquil and master. But very early on, I decided that the only way I was going to survive this was if I had kind of iron discipline of myself. The entire environment is kind of pressing in on you in this little cell. I began daily meditation when I was sitting in the cell. I recognized that immobility was going to be really crippling. And so when I wasn't being interrogated most of the time, I was moving around somehow, just pacing in circles, meditating or thinking about things. And I started doing body weight exercises and yoga, lots and lots of yoga push ups, crunches. I started building a routine from the first week that by day 1,000 was quite detailed. And I think that together with the meditation was crucial for survival. And it also sent a signal to them, right? They interrogate me for three hours, they go at me, and then they send me back to my cell. And the first thing that I do is drop into 50 push ups and crunches and then start planking, sending message to them. So, you know, I started fairly early on having a kind of gratitude prayer that I would start the day with. Things that may sort of seem kind of new agey or silly in a day-to-day situation, but which are existentially essential when you're hanging on your sanity and life by your fingernails. Well-reading stuff. But what it makes you realize is these are serious techniques. Box breathing, for example, other things to sort of try to manage your own parasympathetic nervous system. Navy seals use box breathing techniques. These are not, sort of, you know, hippy, dippy things to do. I also would come up with a bunch of mantras, essentially. Nothing exotic, just sort of repetitive phrases and so on. I literally sort of focused on alliteration. So, it would be things like, you know, I would sort of think of like ten words that started with S that would make you feel somehow sort of instill as it sends a determination. You so like... That's just a little hard to bring back emotionally. Driven, determined, dedicated, disciplined. It's usually sort of basically trying to remind yourself how to be things like that. I built a memory palace for myself of my own life. I basically took a very long walk, starting with my earliest memories all the way to the present day. Partly trying to make sense in some, because when you're in a situation like that, the other thing you're thinking of is, where did I go wrong? What choices did I make in my life that led me to being in a cell in an unknown location in Beijing? How did I mess up that badly? That's a bad way to think about it, but invariably you're too almost trying to contextualize it. So, I went through every moment that I could remember in my life in order, and that took many, many days. They brought me into the interrogation room for what I thought was going to be another, stealing myself for another morning round of interrogations, and the interrogator sitting at the desk, and instead of his usual, always very intimidating stack of files, they would always bring these big, fat stacks of papers and rifling through them, basically in a classic, almost soviet way. On that day, he had a single piece of paper from which he read from in a monotone voice. Four days ago, your partner gave birth to a baby girl. Mother and daughter are healthy. That's all I have for you today. He gets up and walks out and leaves me sitting in the chair for the rest of the morning, locked into it, reflecting on the fact that I have a daughter now, and I can't see her and I wasn't there when she was born. When we in the West wonder, well, if the Communist Party state is so repressive and harsh and increasingly authoritarian, why don't the people rise up against it? I mean, there is very much a high degree of powerlessness, of even the people who are the operators of that very system. They feel like cogs in a machine and the best they can do, in most cases, is to try to protect themselves and their families, maybe try to enrich themselves on the side if they can, but just go along to get along. And for them, it was very hard to accept that the system that they had served loyally and devotedly, they thought all their lives, and most of these people were in their mid to late fifties or older, that that system had now thrown them in the garbage with no recourse, and now was treating them so badly from their perspective. You could look up and see the sky, that was it. Yes, you could look out and you could see the sky. That was very beautiful to see, and sometimes you would have a sunbeam coming through the window, and we would take turns sitting in this beam of sunshine. I think Huawei is just Huawei, China is China. So, late January or early February 2020, the Gordon and his team walked into our cell wearing those big white hazmat suits, complete with goggled gloves and boots. And we're all, my cellmates and I are all looking at each other like, what the heck is this? And it led to us being even more isolated and locked down and sealed up. That was a period for eight months when I had absolutely no contact with the outside world at all. It was like being in a space capsule and Houston control is not answering. I read a lot of philosophy, particularly Stoic and Buddhist philosophy. I found those both the most helpful for me. And it reminds you, perennially, that there are things that are in your control and there are things that are not. But if you focus on your own sphere of control, then you can at least achieve some self-mastery. What really matters at the end of the day is not all these material things or your physical conditions. What matters is wisdom. What matters is virtue and honor and moral integrity. I gave a long statement in which I made it unequivically clear that I thought I was innocent and that I was a political hostage, that I was there because of Mengwan Joe's detention in Canada. And that if the judges had even the slightest bit of independence and sense of justice, they would see the obvious things before them and determine that I was innocent and release me. Now I had no expectation that they would actually do that, of course, but I wanted to put it on the record. That kind of Marxist-Leninist system insists on this sort of performative contrition and repentance. And only then can you be redeemed when you throw yourself in the party's mercy. And I felt that by not playing along, by speaking my truth into their system, it's almost sort of like introducing a virus into a computer, right? That ultimately, I'm not the hostage in that moment. I'm the only man who is master of himself, the only man who is speaking freely. Everyone else is following the system's script. I'd rather not go into it, but let's just say they weren't friendly about it. I did. Tarmac has never tasted better, kind of minimally. Welcome home! A reunion 1,020 days in the making. Michael Covrig and Michael Spavall are now home. The two Canadians embrace by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after touching down in Spavall's hometown of Calgary. That if he held some view that I was in any way complicit in what happened to him, he had 100 opportunities to express that and never did. There's no such thing as being completely safe from that system. And what I would hope that this entire story illustrates is that that is fundamentally not a rule of law system. The Communist Party uses the law as a political tool and weapon. It will adhere to international treaties and agreements when they suit it and ignore them when they don't and subvert them when that suits its purposes or even try to right and revise new ones. In the case of my own detention, they violated my human rights on various counts. They violated the international convention against torture because the treatment they subjected me to is unquestionably psychological torture. They violated the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, the Vienna Convention on consular relations and the Canada China Consular Treaty and a number of other agreements. So if they wouldn't honor those agreements before, why would they honor their own laws and things now? The bottom line of that is that I hope that things will be fine now, but I live in a world where one can never make that assumption. And that is not just with respect to me. This is a hybrid challenge that all countries that value their own sovereign independent decision making need to understand much more clearly. One of the reasons why I wouldn't go along with the false Chinese narrative that they kept trying to construct around us was that ultimately when you start making that kind of compromise, it's a slippery slope. So you need to have a very clear understanding when interacting with anyone from that system, what your values are, what your principles are, but also what your interests are either as an organization or as a country. And you need to be ready to firmly defend those and push back when necessary. The whole point of the post-World War II international order, what we call the liberal rules-based international order, as imperfect as it has been, as flawed, as sometimes hypocritical. But that is fundamentally vastly more benign world than the kind of world that China would drag us into if it were to become the dominant or even a predominant state in shaping world order. That would be a much darker world that would be shaped much more by China's preferences. And do you really want your children to grow up in that world if we can avoid it? And so we've all got to start growing in the same direction. So it seems to me a basic litmus test for any decision is, is this going to undermine the liberal rules-based international order? Is it going to empower what are ultimately hostile, not friendly organizations? And if it is, maybe you shouldn't be doing it. My number one responsibility is to be the best person I can be for my family, the best father I can for my daughter, best partner for my loved ones. Music I see, they're waiting for us. There's a vehicle there. Who? The cup truck. Some soldiers around it. Do we have a very good view of Troshkyfka? And the Soviet capricide that somebody with an aerial? They're behind us. 12 kilometers behind us. And if you stand up, can you see their lines? No, it's a little bit further. One cross is a cross, and the other one is a bit bigger. Yes. OK, well, let's move before they see us too much. Somewhere out there, though I can't see him either, is Vlad. My call name is Pright. I'm a captain, commander of the mortar unit. I'm staying in a field, not far from my positions. I'm really close to the front line. I'm going to hear the sound of explodes. Under my command is like 42 people. So to add some context, we are now fighting in the Donetsk region. Half of my men and women are staying in a battle positions, really close to the enemies, and working from their mortars. What's going on here? What's going on here? They start moving from... This big forest... to our position over here. And we see how they start moving. Over here we destroyed one tank. Here, BMP, you can see it with video over here. A Russian soldier comes to this antenna and something fixed there on this antenna. What do you think they fixed to that antenna? I think this is maybe communication between artillery and some flying... That's why you want to take it. 33 years old now. It's started over. Kamikadze, Babayaha, Dagnorodya, Sudi, is an autotiche. So in sugar hole complex, the drones from the reconnaissance drones to strike drones, Kamikadze drones, the bombers, the whole range. And now two and a half years into the war, I am trying to work out what is likely to happen in the next six months or one year. We are talking about the wind enemy reconnaissance drones. Then the enemy is far ahead, because they were preparing for this even before the start of the war in 2014. So if we're talking about that particular class, it's been modernized, Russia has an obvious superiority there, because Ukraine, in effect, only really started developing its own complexes of this kind at the start of the full scale invasion. They don't have better drones. They have a lot of drones. Sometimes there's 12 drones for one tank. Our forces are throwing more than one million and 300,000 flying on the frontline. 1,300,000 drone flights in one month on the frontline or in one month. Pavlovrad also has an explosive factory, a military complex there. What is interesting about Pavlovrad is that it still has an active coal mine. A good chunk of the workforce now are women in 500 since 2022, simply because the local mines have been asked to provide a certain amount of manpower for the front. And it's interesting in not being necessarily what you'd call a front line city. It is a city where people are near enough and close enough to the missiles that land to be thinking about war every day and about the consequences of what war would look like if it continued. What was that bus that just went by? It looked like a kind of police bus. It was a bus with police sirens. So if you looked closely at the front of that bus was the sign 300. Now in military terms, 300 means severely wounded. 200 means dead. And you see these 300 lorries buses coming past pretty frequently along this road. Because it's the main road from Pukrovsk and other theatres in the Donbas. Tudnipro, one of the main military hospitals. Since 2014, Nipro has been the... And here we go, the sirens you hear in the background. Where do you want us to hear? I think we should probably move to different places now. So we go to somewhere which is more central and less likely to be hit than a petrol station, which is now to be used by military people. I don't know, I got really, really sad seeing this bus. I'm here, so... Mine, they're pretty frequent. They're pretty frequent. And the fact it's a big bus as well. It was a very big bus that the bigger the losses, the bigger the buses. Hello. Hello, hello. So you're selling your apartment? No, it's not mine, it's my children's house. And why are they selling it? They were selling flowers to Poland, they bought a house there, right? And they were selling flowers here. So they left to Poland and they already got an apartment there, so they don't need the apartment. So they're not coming back? They really want to come back, but I don't think they will. And what about you? How do you feel with the front coming closer? I love Ukraine, I'm a nationalist. I really love it. And I will do everything I can to win Ukraine. I really love Ukraine, I would call myself a nationalist, Ukrainian nationalist, and I will do anything for Ukraine to win this war. And do you think that most people in Pavlokhrad share your views? Want the war to continue and want to Ukraine in victory? We have a few patriotic, un-religious Ukrainians, but the last time when they came to the war, they were in a mess. So there is quite a lot of people in Pavlokhrad, who are like pro-Ukrainian people. But since the big war, and we have many people, many incomeers from Eastern Ukraine, from the Nets region, and I would call, I would divide them into two groups, some of them are like they don't care, and the rest, they are quite pro-Russian. So now the city is mixed with different views. And how would you feel if the Russians end up taking all of the Netsk? If they are just 50 kilometers down the road is Russia. We do partisan. And what would you do as a partisan? I would cook for the soldiers. Yes, until the last Ukrainian. There are many people in the West now who say it is time for a peace deal. A peace deal where Russia keeps the territory that it has taken. And the Ukraine keeps what it has still got, but doesn't get it back. This will never happen. This will never happen. This will never happen. This will never happen. But we will never allow this to happen. To even if the government here agrees this, you will keep fighting. Because we are Ukrainians and we will just destroy the government, the Ukrainian government, and together with Russians. We will be fighting. Yes, so one girl, she's 19 years old, she said that she is for anything that can stop fighting basically. And she says, if they want to do the best, let's give it to them. Her other son is 41 and she is trying to get him out from the front. She had a lawyer and she lost her husband. She basically lost every end she after the funeral. She's gone blind. Her blind, she was sitting there with a four-year-old gran kid. And I just don't care. I just want this to stop. Yeah. Come and sit over there and we'll go and meet our dear one. And I'll sit between you guys. So, we must say we have not enough weapon. Yep. And so we have not enough people. If you use some person like me, you must roll one paper. If you use some stuff, you must roll three paper. So do you think your commanders don't care about your life? Yes, of course. I guess so. I'm not a get. I have not nine wives. I have only one wife. And that is why it's very scary. I can't imagine how scary this must be. And then the contact line, you are two kilometers from the Russians. Yep. And so any movement, they have drones, they will see. Yes, of course. And describe what life is like for you at the contact line. It's very difficult. What do you do, you underground? Yes, of course. If you find some, Yes, when I am, if you find a dagger, a hammer or a hole. A.K. For the seven. That's it. And your role there is to stop the Russians advancing. And there are more of them. Of course. We live our local and our commanders say, they are the ones who are in the desert. So they accuse you of desertion? Yes. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Maybe now rest. Maybe one week. Are they looking for you? And you say you should? I do. You should. So I'm now moving through the forest from the positions back to the core, to the Jeep. I checked all of three of my positions. Spoke with my guys, checked their hidden spots, everything, how they cover motors or zeleves. Do they have internet from the position that they have no batteries? I'm sitting in my car in front of my apartment in Constantinivka, Donetsk region. A few days ago I have a new experience in this war. My guys got a captive, so the Russian soldier. So the holster was that on my mortar positions become too dangerous. I planned the operation when the drones, they should bomb the position where Russians stay, and by how we close to our guys, took them and ran away. On the way back, I just turned around and I see that in the how we were sitting the guy with the bag on his head, and my guys laughing like, oh, we took one Russian with us. So when we came back to the base, we had time to speak with him to ask the question who he is, why he came. In general, he, like, 40-year-old Russian men, he was like two years in the army, but doing some help for work, like drive from one position to another, and he came from the front line. And at this month, his commanders just make an order to, oh, it was close, to put him on the front line, and it was his first fight, and he put his hands up. I'm yours. Yes, of course, expectation from the winter, winter is huge challenge for us. They tried to freezing our population to leave winter difficult without electricity, heating, water. It's very important to be honest, to tell the people truth. And we calculate many different scenarios. And also worst case scenario, and that's why we tell people we are responsible for that, but you have to count for yourself. You have to be prepared. Please, you need to have reserve of drink water in your home, food, battery to survive in some period of time when you didn't have services. Difficult, but people still unbroken. Let's talk about the domestic political environment. It's been a long time, two and a half years, and Ukrainians want victory, but they're also getting tired of being at war. How do you, as a political leader, how do you explain what victory is to people? It's a difficult question. What I mean to bring this piece back to Ukraine to give up the big part of our territory, because the Russian occupied Crimea is part of Ukraine, and Russians told, let's find solution. Compromise. It's difficult to explain to the people its solution to give up the big part of our homeland to Russians. It's not solution. It's compromise. It's not. But the wish for every Ukrainian to bring peace back to Ukraine. How long is it peace? Very difficult political solution. Wish have to do it. President of Ukraine. Zelensky, he is a responsibility to do that. Listen, for this question, I guess nobody is ready to give you clear answer. So this victory plan, in short, is to give you the best and strongest position for any future peace negotiations. It's possible to say so, but I always want to little bit clarify the phrase peace negotiations, because it's necessary to understand. This is position of the president of all teams who are in the state of the world. and says Ukraine needs an iron clad guarantee, NATO membership. It's the most strongest guarantees now which exist in the world. We understand that full membership is possible only after the war. But we don't see any problems, any difficulties, to give the invitations to Ukraine, because it's very much strengthening our positions. There is no question of the resilience. Question is more to you and to the free world, how much of endurance you have. Because without you, we would have been already gone. But with you, we're stronger. I think there is a fatigue in the United States. A fatigue and in Europe. It's not that people don't want to support Ukraine. They have other concerns. It's not so high on the priorities. And so I ask you, if the endurance is not there from the West, not cutting off Ukraine, but just less support, which I think is the most likely, actually, less support. The opinion, Putin's Russia, the longer it gets, the weaker Putin's Russia is going to get. That's in my personal opinion. Because when the mayor said it right, when you think you're tired, think about the other side, they are exhausted too. And they call for the peace. We know they will come back. And now it's the choice. When they're going to be back, they're going to be stronger and better. I believe that now all in or nothing, that my personal opinion, all year or nothing, because the other moment, the other side, is exhausted too, tremendously exhausted. And I believe now is the moment of time where we just need to put our strength together. We cannot only rely on our heroic people, our heroic soldiers. We need to have significant support with the artillery, with the tanks, and again with the permission with the long-range weapon. As an old Greek philosopher, the strong do what they do and the weakers suffer what they must. In that regard, nothing changes. We need to be strong, definitely. For my understanding, first, as a NATO member, there is some guarantee that we will not have that horrible war in the future with Russia. But if not, we need to be much more stronger that we are now in order to prevent aggression. We need to be prepared ourselves, I mean Ukrainians. By no doubt of that, 100%. And I think now we are not only taking experience and knowledge from our NATO partners, definitely we have something to share with the NATO members country as well. It's amazing, made out of fresh wood, it smells of wood. It smells like a soda. It's like a soda. Yes, this is amazing. This is the Reds. This is the worst case is arrived here. We are walking through a woodblock into an NATO, this is the operating theatre. Huge amounts of equipment and it's all in an underground, what, 15, 10 metres ventilation, six and almost 1 metre, 80, 1 metre, 90. The radius is 2, 2 and a half metres, 2.5 metres. Is the full ICU so someone comes in here, if not breathing, not serious? Yes, we use the torches. And you see the monitor, cardio-monitor, ventilation, inspiration, capnogra. Vladimir Putin didn't attack when President Trump was in office. We have four years of history. I'll take that back. We have 15 and a half years of history. Eight years of Barack Obama, four years of President Trump, and now three and a half years of President Biden. Any question for the Ukrainian people of those years, which were the years that they were safest and didn't have any of their land stolen by a thug coming out of Russia? They piecemealed it out. So a little bit here, a little bit there, and then adjacent to that always spoke about the risk of escalation instead of the opportunity for victory. And that is a psychological shortcoming, right? It's a model that says, when you're constantly telling your adversary the things you won't do or your friends the things they can't do, because, quote, escalation end of quote, you're empowering the bad guys to test your model, to test how far they can push. No one should labor under a fantasy that there is anyone resembling Rex Tillerson, or General Mattis, ever getting within a mile of Trump's what he has. His national security team is going to be the creepiest, most reckless group of hyper isolationists you have ever seen. I think there'll be continuity between Biden and Harris when it comes to supporting Ukraine. Obviously, there'll be some differences. I can't speak to exactly what pace of delivery and what systems Kamala Harris will be most interested in. Kamala Harris is going to fight for Ukraine. That's the difference in the selection. I think Europe is capable to step up a lot. Chris I'm Freuding. I'm the director of joint planning and command staff in the Ministry of Defence of Germany. Especially as a European defence market is very small and the possibilities to increase defence production are limited. So this is a new opportunity. We would like to look into. And of course, this would be of mutual benefit for the Ukrainians but for the whole European defence market as well. that others in NATO do not have and are the things you can and will learn from them? Absolutely. Absolutely right. We want to learn from them. We must learn from them because the nature of war has changed during the last two years. And we have to learn from that when we have to adapt and we have to do this very fast. It is the most experienced armed forces we have in Europe. At this time, it would be rather stupid not to get a chance or to use a chance to learn from them. I don't think history repeats itself. But it rhymes. But it rhymes sometimes and sometimes you can get inspiration from his historic examples. I think right now, Ukraine's focus has to be on winning this war and not spending and in order to amount of energy trying to ultimately win a future invitation to China. I think the political logic in Kiev for doing that is that it helps domestically sell something that is not quite total victory as you describe it. What? I feel like I know you. We're going to the hotel. We're going to the hotel. We're going to the hotel. I'm not going to the kitchen. If it's okay, because I'm starving a little bit. It is okay, so what if you want? Okay, nice. No, it's not a victory. It's not a victory. It's loose. It's a victory for Russia. And I can only imagine what will come after that with the people who are not on the war. Because as I feel, most of them think like, okay, victory, come on, come on, army, we are fighting, sitting on their couches. And they will be so much disappointed like what? Where is our borders of 91? So I'm afraid it will be some, again, revolution and all this and Russia will take advantage of that. The West is the most powerful country in the world. Honestly, it's the third year of the war of my war sitting here. I am too tired to tell no, I will fight till the end, I will put my life, no, we will not do any exceptions, we will go to the borders of 91st year. No, I am too tired, honestly. I will be upset, of course, but not so much to become a partisan and to go in a forest to fight till the end. Thank you. The Economist There is more spelled blood than drinkable water in Gaza. Food is not being allowed in enough amounts, and hospitals are being evacuated, are being targeted. There is nowhere in Gaza that is safe. The level of destruction is beyond probably anywhere that anyone's ever seen since somebody visited Dresden after the Second World War. It's flat. Buildings are destroyed everywhere you go. You see, you know, smash concrete and twisted iron and rebar, everything's destroyed. That's an armoured vehicle, isn't it? That's a talent thing. That's a talent thing. That's a talent thing. And what you're hearing here, I'll try. I'm trying to concentrate on the constant buzz, the drones. You'll be hearing a case in the boom, which is usually some kind of idea for covering. Those, even before the war, who were a soundtrack constantly in Gaza, surveillance drones, not attack drones, but they were always moving. You tell the difference between a surveillance drone and an attack drone. Should I feel like an ought to get my ear out and try it? I would try it. I'll hold it on. Because it was too many things last time. Why on that one? It'll be awful. Here, you can see the fence now. This is the border. And this is where we put helmets on. The level of destruction is pretty complete. I mean, thinking about coming back into Gaza, say, after the war in 2014, there were neighbourhoods like Shajahia on the border, on the eastern border, that were very, very badly hit, but they were still sort of recognisable as what they were. You can see where the streets were, where the apartment blocks were. Here, it's just sort of very organised and complete destruction, where on both sides of the road, what you see is just piles of rubble. The corridor ahead, Thanos. Thanos is recommending north Gaza to south Gaza. Those operatives are operational, Thanos. For Hamas, to conduct a control over Gaza and the north and the south. Yes, yes. Saasah. Two rockets have been pulled in next to us. 150 yards from us. Okay. And how often do rockets come like that? Is that all the time or is that of... I'll be quite today. Couple of days ago, with casual fees. Yeah, I heard that. Because of this kind of rocket, isn't it? So they fired from the city of Gaza and also from the south part of Wales. The minute conflict ends, you already need to have your plan ready to go. What's the police presence going to be? Who's going to talk to the civilians on the ground about when they can go home and what services they can have? And apps in that planning, you have set the foundations for long term, perpetual conflict, which is devastating for civilians in Gaza and also really damaging and threatening for Israel's long term security. And up until five months ago, I was the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, which means I was the top civilian official in the Pentagon leading implementation of American defense policy. We have plenty of examples of what it looks like for this planning to not happen. Societies that don't have a legitimate security presence to look to will go into whatever opportunity or entity there is for them to have some semblance of security, which basically means what we have in Gaza right now. It's either local criminal gangs, local armed groups, and in many places in Gaza, Hamas, who's actually providing security, making decisions about the distribution of humanitarian aid on the ground. There are remnants of that previous security force that was affiliated with the Palestinian Authority before Hamas violently kicked them out. There are expectations that they would be willing to be retrained, come out of Gaza, get that training, get that equipment, and go back in. But it's going to be very challenging for that local security force. There's not a clear chain of command and control that's legitimate in the eyes of the local population. And finally, there's a likelihood that the remnants of Hamas and other violent extremists in Gaza are going to challenge that security force. Some would say he's already teetered to the other side of loss of legitimacy in the eyes of the Palestinian population in the West Bank. Yes, and many across the Middle East and internationally are also talking about this. So here we are in downtown Ramallah outside the government buildings. We're about to go and see the Prime Minister. Hi, I'm Shrinevind Zimbettos, very nice to meet you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, okay, I'm going to say the following. I'm going to say that from Palestinian government perspective, we have a responsibility towards our people in Gaza. This is a responsibility. And second, I would say that the lives of additional hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza is at stake here. If there is going to be a vacuum in governance and security in the next period, hundreds of thousands of people will be affected by this. I will also say that the only answer, in my opinion, is through the presence and the enabling of a legitimate, delegitimate and the responsible government of Palestine to be in place with our people to support them through this very difficult time. And take them through this transition, hopefully towards recovery, towards reconstruction and better governance and stability for the region. In the absence of all of this, I'm afraid there will be more deaths and more instability that will affect not only our people in Gaza, but also people in the region. So I'll stop here. Thank you. This is my home. This is the villa. This is this woman pulled. And this is how it is. That's it now. Oh my God, that is it. Sometimes we were working 15, 18 hours a day, business where it was perfect. I know that this is something for normal people like in Britain, nobody would think of, but for Gassons to have 24 hours electricity since 17 years, it's a dream. And when foreign dignitaries came to Gaza, I guess like Tony Blair, John Kerry, like Catherine Ashton, Shahabil would host them. I was acting if you wish like a minister of foreign affairs for Gaza. So you were clearly at the very top of the Gaza elite. What was it like with Hamas in charge? Were you close to Hamas? I was not close to Hamas. I had relations. I must have some kind of relations. I used to, for instance, many of my clients, if they are international clients, they always prevent them from paying any kind of taxes in Gaza. So I used to negotiate how we can manage that through public service. For instance, some donations, buying some medicines. Alternative tax payments. Alternative methods. So I said we will pay for road in Gaza and that will be our taxes for this year and next year. In 2015, a bomb was placed on the gate of my villa. And it was a timing bomb. It exploded after two minutes of ringing the bell. So we were lucky that I asked my son not to go down and open the door. I didn't know who exactly. But I can say that one should suspect who's in charge. Come on. You said it. I was inside my office. The car was outside. And the Jeep received 21 bullets by a known person. This was another message. And were you politically active? I think when in my position should be, I was trying to bridge the gap between Fatahan Hamas. I played a huge role, along with some other independent personalities from Gaza and West Bank, back and forth to try to bridge the gap. And all of a sudden, a massive number of missiles start to be shelt from different areas in Gaza. I said, let's see whether we are going to stay on the 7th. On the 7th? Let's wait whether we are going to stay on Earth or we will be buried soon. I anticipated some huge reaction from the Israelis, but definitely I was not anticipating this against the whole Gaza strip. I don't like to call it Hamas police, because they are not Hamas, they are civil police in Gaza. They were vetted by the way in 2017. They vetted by the Swiss Americans, they did the vetted. Let's put aside the leadership, which might be Hamas. I'm talking about the normal police man, traffic police man or a security or whatever. Those are civil servants, and those deserve to be given their chance to continue serving. And those people can provide the security, and they are well known to the people. They have their own respect. And what will be the relationship between the civil police and Hamas? I don't think that Hamas, or should be in the picture on the day to the running of the life of the civilians in Gaza. And they have several times said that we are willing to step back from governing Gaza or ruling Gaza or controlling Gaza. Well, you're asking me if I'm committing any illegal activities or not? I'm asking you as a, as a, a, a, a leader now, who is clearly very practical and who wants to do what is most effective. I guess if I put it to a different way, do you think you can make any progress on the path you've laid out without actively talking to Hamas? I don't think so. I don't think so, but I am willing to, to, to do whatever I'm asked by the Prime Minister and the President in order to achieve what we are supposed to achieve. But we have tough men on the ground. They will confront any threat. And I think these three are at the listen in the world to 2014. They did achieve any victory, they have been killed, captured and get out. After nine months supported by all these superpowers, they cannot have a soldier who can move freely in Gaza. Okay, they can come with tanks, they can shell from the sea and from the ground, from the air. But how much are they able to stay there and to control the area? I am here accidentally because I left Gaza one week before for a conference in Istanbul. The curve is steadily rising upwards towards what? Towards Hamas is today stronger when it comes to popularity, when it comes to its political position within the Palestinian arena, the international level, when it comes to the capability of Hamas to fight for its goals of freedom and dignity of the Palestinian people. I give at least one per thousand that such a dream of the Israelis would work. All the clans, the big families in Gaza, they are by nature much more nationalistic than anyone can believe. You can find one person who is willing to collaborate with the Israelis, but you cannot find their family. And the Israeli wishes is not a command of others that can be fulfilled just by Plankovanai. Almost every day there are protests, sometimes large weekend marches with tens of thousands or smaller groups who are out like these on a Wednesday evening. Sometimes there's not the road for a few minutes, there will be a bit of anger with these things, it's a good thing to sit on them now. And now there is a excuse letting the hostages disappear. I know one thing, there is no absolute victory, there is no such thing. It's a trick to prolong the war. My brother got into Gaza to protect us, to bring back the hostages. And if we stop the fire now, then he died for nothing. It's very striking when you're here in Israel. The mood here is just so different than anywhere in the rest of the world, in the sense that you see everywhere, look hostage sides everywhere. Bring them home now, bring them home. There are statues to hostages, there are protests. Unless I actually bring it up, no one brings it up in any conversation ever. And I think that's, you know, if you're having a policy conversation, if you're talking to anybody in the Israeli army, it's all about security. If you're talking to politicians, it's about different ways to ensure Israel's future security. You know, the polls were turning against a two-state solution, even before October 7th. But that just seems so far away from people's sense of what the challenge is here. They just look, bring them home, scribble there and graffiti. Everywhere, it's the hostages, and it's Israeli security. That's the prism through which this is seen. There will be Palestinians that control the municipal issues, including security, but we will have an ability to get in and out whenever we would like to. And will it be the PA or some other? I don't care. I know for my heart that it does matter. Whoever will hate Israel. Right now you are the occupying force, you are the aggressors, you've destroyed the place, you've killed 30,000-plus garsans. They hate you, and understandably so. Look, if they slaughtered kids and women, and the party members before the 7th of October probably has hated me before what's happening now. The kilometers that I spoke about in order to build something that will control Gaza, the hills, we can use it for agriculture, for example. But it doesn't matter, the end of the day what we are doing is we are trying to destroy the infrastructure of Hamas. But if tomorrow morning some actors from the international community will say, look, Israelis we are going to be there, we are going to rebuild Gaza, we are going to control and to make sure that no one is a... Shalom. Are you fans? Hello. Shalom, Shalom. We now have a number of... Okay, I'm sorry. The potential vote is coming first for you. That's right, it's going to be the next classic. Shalom, Alain. Can I have a glass of water? One of the most complicated things I have. Okay, close. Zero. And you want to talk to all of you. The black dots are always a built. The red dots and the light red dots are what they're in the plan. This is a map of the takeover, the illegal takeover against the Oslo Accords by the Palestinians. The Arab population in Judean Samaria. Before we can even start talking about the day after, we need to put Gaza, and the day after, through what you would call the denazification program to make sure that those views are not accepted. Because if it does, there is no day after. At the first stage of course, Israel needs to have control. Military wise, 100% because you have to make sure that Hamas does not get the humanitarian support and uses its to rebuild its powers. And I don't use the term occupy. Re-settled. Re-settled is another question. Once you have the military control, what do you do? Do you put civilian there? You put only army there? But for me, again, this is a question that to talk about it now, it's just irrelevant. This is a decar�ta. No value for anything. We're meeting Yehugaland in the Labour faction room, but it's not on the same corridor as the main faction. It's such a small party. This party that founded Israel is now at the very edge of, basically in Siberia of the Knesset. We were looking for a bottle of water in the kitchenette and all the colours were full of lure oil, because it's not. Not even a functioning kitchen they have there, so I kind of share it. It is an easy issue. I start with the easy stuff. Unfortunately, our government has no plan for the Gaza Strip right now. And I think the main reason for that is not because it's so hard to imagine how to move forward with the gaseins, or with Hamas, or with any other Palestinian element in the Gaza Strip. The main issue here is political considerations. And this is a shame, because it's so wrong to conduct a war without clear political goals. It's not enough to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas. You need to provide alternative. Because without alternative, all we will get is less and less law and order, an ongoing threat of terror. What is the shape of the new alternative? I think that the Palestinian authority alone cannot do it. Why? It's too weak. So they need help. Help could be provided by the moderate Sunnis countries. Their interests is to stabilize the region and to block the influence of Iran in any destabilizing area. Most Arab militaries don't have training in how to do local policing in humanitarian functions. And this is not going to be war. This is going to be stabilization, reconstruction and recovery activities. What's going to happen if Hamas fires on these Arab boots on the ground to challenge the legitimacy of their presence? So I think for many Arab capitals, the idea of Arab on Arab violence, what the rules of engagement would be to fire back. And what the practice that perpetuates cycles of conflict and then does the local population see those military boots on the ground as benevolent or as part of an occupying force? All they need from Israel in order to materialize this interest in the Gaza Strip is one thing. Please say that you still support this two-state solution. That's it. I claim that we need to create islands of hope. And the island of hope would be what you clear, you have people in the area where someone else, rather than Hamas, takes control, knows how to protect this enclave, and know how to provide much a better civil services for the Gaza Strip. I'm Nufthali Bennett, former Prime Minister of Israel. We should take a piece of Gaza, let's say, from Gaza-Wadi Northward, and then set the stage and say the following. It's going to take a while, bear with us, our friends, but at the end of it we're going to form a Gaza 2.0 here. But first, it would have to be cleared and emptied. I would define that area as a fully military area. I would say civilians have a week to leave and create actual havens for them, but do it. Not say you're actually doing it. Apply immediate full siege of water, fuel on that area while you still allow anyone to leave through a screen. You got to bring in a bunch of competent regional players and find competent local leadership, and that would be appointed, it could not in the first instance be democratic. But on that plot of land, let's call it Northern Gaza, and then all of Gaza, gradually, set it on its feet and learn the lessons from post-World War II reconstruction. Be very generous there and build the future, and discontinue the brain poisoning. I think certainly not in the foreseeable future, because they have proven to be deeply corrupt, deeply incompetent. And I'm fairly confident that once we defeat Hamas, we'll be able to find reasonable players. We'd identify competent officials at various levels. If you're an amazing water engineer and you ran the water system, so we'll use you. And at the end of the day, water system is pipes and not ideology. I want you to imagine surviving bombing, displacement, starvation, dehydration for nine months, and you're still being ordered again to evacuate. People do not have the physical energy to evacuate anymore, and those who evacuate are fleeing with that mattresses, with that food. They're running down the street in confusion. Children are getting separated from their parents. They're isn't water to drink and they're isn't enough bread to eat. There is more spelled blood than drinkable water in Gaza. Food is not being allowed and enough amounts. Hospitals are being evacuated, are being targeted. There is nowhere in Gaza that is safe. You only need to spend an hour in Gaza City and Jabalyeh, in Bait Hanoun, in Khan Unis, in Patsad-derabella, in Raffa today, to see the level of destruction is beyond probably anywhere that anyone has ever seen since somebody visited Dresden after the Second World War. It's flat. Buildings are destroyed everywhere you go, you see smashed concrete and twisted iron and ribeur, everything is destroyed. There are very few police, there are very few people to keep the peace in areas. So you've seen significant increases in criminality. You've seen lawlessness to a point that is beyond my experience anywhere else, because people are so desperate. Crime is something that some have turned to, and it's very violent. Life is too cheap. So we've seen people hurt, people killed, for very little. A box of frozen chicken, a bag of wheat flour. It's kind of frightening to see the level of violence in some areas. Only three ATMs are now functioning in the middle area, supposed to cover the needs of around 2 million. During this conflict, I lived times when I had to trade sugar for salt and yeast. And a couple days ago my friend told me that she had to trade gold for cigarettes. Money is a big problem. One cigarette is worth $25. One cigarette. So now cigarettes are not just for smokers. The cigarettes are the tradable currency of Gaza. The cigarettes coming primarily from Egypt through the Karam Shalom, Israeli crossing into the Strip, has added more violence and lawlessness in that area. You will talk about Gaza becoming Mogadishu on the med. Is it already Mogadishu on the med? I think there are moments where you are in places that it seems like there is a complete breakdown of law and order and it feels that you are in a Mad Max movie. But it's not everywhere. And you still can go into a community where the local mayors, the older women of the community, the respected people have organized themselves and looking after the young ones and looking after the most vulnerable and looking after disabled people and trying to make sure that they support their community. And who do you have? Who provides the security for you? In what sense? You said that you have the convoys and then they are accompanied. Who is accompanying them? We are accompanying them. There is no security in terms of police force or we don't use armed security. We are going ourselves. We are essentially relying on our team's ability to talk their way through issues and incidents. They are my brothers and my cousins and my sons etc. So am I going to attack them? No. But nothing is moving. Because apparently this war is not a traditional war. As you know, genocide and part of the system is to make people hungry and running from place to place. Yes, my family, I am from Gaza. I lost my father and my house and my father's house in this war. My family they were running from Gaza. The city we were living just close to Shifaos bit. Running to Hanyunus. According to the ultimate made by the Israeli IDF. But they are even trying to kill people moving to those secure places, hit those secure places. I mean, you shouldn't then move people, clean that place the way you like and then move people to it. You have been nine months now. You failed. You failed Nitya, you failed. Split Gaza into our three pieces by those corridors is creating like Netsarim corridor. And he would like to continue this hot pursuit mechanism of killing in Masaerat tomorrow in Jabalia after tomorrow in Gaza in Rafa'han. And so forth, we are not Iraq. We are not Afghanistan. Those models, you have applied them there and you failed. It's our land here. It's our issue, our question. I believe it will be the largest refugee camp in the world. It used to be for the last 17 years the largest prison prison in the world. Continuing 2.3 million people. Now it will be the largest refugee internally displaced people camp in the world. The world have not seen that before. Guinness record. And that is disastrous when I think about it. Because I know that there are 40 million tons of rabbi. There are 10,000 bodies under the rabbi. There are children lost arms and legs. There are women, pregnant women, they cannot eat, they cannot be treated. There are elderly people killed by thousands. This is not a war. Again, it's militants. This is killing of people and converting this huge area into refugee and displacement and internal displaced camp. A huge one, intense and you live 10 years and those tens until we find you some mechanism of rebuilding. Can we do that Madame here and do a bank for us? We will not compromise anything for the long lasting political solution of the two states. If we stay in camps for another 100 years, simply we need a solution rather than a temporary measures. Because we have people in Israel here are making life nightmare for the people in the West Bank. Are you going to allow the Palestinian to pursue them? Hot pursuit? Like they are giving hot pursuit for Hamas and Gaza? You are not. You are looking at one angle only. So it looks pretty sturdy this thing, why does it keep collapsing? The J-lots, the pier is a very complex operation. And the problem here is the shore. And because of the sand makes it a very, very shallow area. You The Economist Many European countries have a fraught relationship with tourists. They need the money they bring in, but they dislike the toll that takes. And they fear that their cities are losing what makes them unique, that they're becoming a similar acrum of their former self, almost a theme park. In recent months, the weekend intelligence has taken us to Lagos and Mumbai to ask who these cities are for. Today we want to think about what a city really is. We love cities because they're strong vibrant spaces that are always altering, always shifting. When a city prosperous, people are drawn to it. But the arrival of all that money and all those newcomers, well, they make the place something different. I'm Rosie Bloor and this is the weekend intelligence. In our later city dispatch, my colleague Lane Green brings us a story of gentrification from Madrid. Madrid has a long history of absorbing new people and new influences. It prides itself on its openness, both to new migrants and to fleeting visitors. This European capital was once a backwater. Yet in just a few years, it has become the place to be. And the flurry of new arrivals, including Lane, poses a challenge. How does a city thrive and welcome change, without being carried away by it? How do you show it? Blasda de Olovi de, on a glorious September day. It's a circular pedestrianized plaza with bars and restaurants all around. Two playgrounds allow the little ones to have fun while their parents have a drink in the bite. Young couples cuddle, ancient grandmother's, or gently shepherded around by their elderly daughters. If you're in this plaza that you'll find, in my opinion, the neighborhood's best wine bar run by a Colombian. And the local music school, where my 12-year-old son, learns the drums. The plaza is round, but the Escuela Popular de Música y Danza, you could call it the cornerstone of life here. Madrid is a place for living. It's a life. A recent history of it was branded as a biography, as though it were a person, and that was appropriate. Words like vibrant are almost clichés in describing it. What it isn't is perhaps a better way to describe what it is. It is an ancient-like Paris in London with their Roman foundations. It isn't beautiful like its great Spanish rival Barcelona. It has no beach, being about as far from the water as you can get in a famously beachy country. Madrid is a place to be, not to do. Walking and talking, or even better, sitting and drinking and talking. I came here to this city in the summer of 2021 as the economist's Spain correspondent. And when looking for a place to live, I found what seemed to me to be the perfect spot to enjoy exactly this Madrid that I've described right here on Plaza de Oliveira. I had dinner with an old friend here when I was looking for a neighborhood to live in, and when I did, my wife and I instantly agreed that it had to be here. We found a flat, moved in, and we're happy. And we made friends with a gaggle of local dog owners, a great way to get to know Spaniard's day and to hear what's on their mind. And what's on their mind, a lot, is how the city and how this neighborhood have changed in just a few short years. There are more and more tourists. Foreign residents are arriving in numbers they've never seen before. And unlike previous generations of immigrants, mostly from Latin America, these are newcomers from rich countries with high salaries and expensive habits that are changing the very city they came to enjoy. It led me to the question at the heart of this podcast. How do you enjoy something that you change by enjoying it? Remember me telling you about that great wine bar on the Plaza? Well, this is Andrés, the owner. My wife and I come by a lot. Until recently, we lived directly upstairs, which is a bit dangerous. And Andrés and I often chat about what's going on in the neighborhood. He tells me that the starting point of the change in his mind was COVID. He's Colombian and came to Madrid to learn about the wine business. Thinking he'd take what he knew back to Colombia. Instead, he learned that Colombian import rules would make that near impossible. In any way, he had fallen in love with Madrid. He set up here instead, opening the shop in 2010. Andrés won't try to sell you an expensive wine. He quite likes giving you the perfect one for your taste, which he remembers from your last visit. He has a paring skill I've never seen in anyone else. He made a wine I didn't like. Tastes fantastic after I tried a bit of the cheese he'd chosen. In between taking deliveries, Andrés mentioned to me that this August, his business had been up 50% on last August. And he wasn't entirely sure how he felt about that fact. He also tells me that 30% of his customers are foreigners. In tourist season, when Madrid Llanos get out of town, but foreigners have a vacation, there are days when more than half of his customers are foreigners. When Andrés arrived in Madrid, his landlord couldn't sell his flat for 300,000 euros. So he led it to Andrés instead. Now, an identical flat downstairs sells for more than twice that. A typical story of a city on the rise. But this is an astronomical amount for Madrid Llanos. The median income in the Madrid region is just about 1700 euros per month, meaning half the people make less than that. Somebody, where Plaza de Ola Viva is situated, is hardly poor. It's one of the city's nicest neighborhoods. But even people on good salaries earn much less than their equivalents in Paris, or London, or New York. As the neighborhood has changed, business is booming. And it's changed how Andrés thinks about the business. For example, hiring staff. He tells me that he never used to prioritize hiring English-speaking staff, but now he sees it as vital. One thing you'll notice in Madrid or in Spain more generally, is that relatively little English is spoken. Spanners are a little sheepish about this, and they are trying hard to improve. Increasingly, they realize they need to. Complaints about change. Nimbism are inevitable when a city grows this quickly. But there are a few special qualities about the changes in Madrid. The city has always been welcoming, both to internal migrants from elsewhere in Spain, and later to large numbers of Latin Americans like Andrés. Madrid prides itself on being wide open. But the new migrants and the tourists are now coming with such a speed that even a place that's been made by migrants is starting to doubt how fast it can keep up. Andrés is seeing that pace of change in his business. His new customer base is buying nicer wines. Explains that as the neighborhood changes, the people that arrive have greater purchasing power than the ones that have left. On the surface, this all sounds good for Andrés. His business is clearly benefiting from the changes taking place in the neighborhood. But he's wary of the way that the terraces like the ones leading up to the plaza are being homogenized with bars and cafes and restaurants. He tells me that the plaza is under serve your beer, the food isn't great, and he dislikes the people smoking next to him. And he says that it's like a theme park. This is a catchphrase. You hear a lot when you ask people what they fear. Madrid is becoming a barque temático, a theme park. There's a simple irony here. Those people coming to enjoy Madrid's vibrancy, it's Vida de Barrio, or neighborhood life with all the old man bars and small shops and vasi little squares, change it by coming. Well, I say they, but I mean we because I'm one of them. We push rents up when we rent flats, pricing out older tenants. Airbnb takes flats off the market, pushing rents up even further. Those old man bars close and are replaced by more expensive chains that cater to international tastes. The shoe repair shop, the locksmith, the stationer, people providing services to the locals are replaced with more and more bars and restaurants. When you're stuck in traffic, you'll do well to remember you are the traffic. And when you move to a city and complain about gentrification, it's the same lesson. You are change. You're complaining about it. ... Journalists have to remind themselves regularly not to take their nice international middle-class neighborhoods as typical of the whole city that they work in, much less the whole country. So my producer Sam and I take the Metro, which is excellent, by the way, though many Madrid linos avoid it for some reason, to Arganthuela, a district on the southern end of town. I'd heard a retired geology teacher on the radio saying that the neighborhood was getting lots of investment from the city, but that none of it was for ordinary people. It's the neighborhood of Mytecola, the president of an association, fighting for the local residents. For her, money is rapidly changing the neighborhood beyond recognition. Do you know how much this area has changed? Incredible. There were before 20 years ago, some small houses, one to hide, you know. Hyras apartments have come to dominate the neighborhood, physical embodiments of a changed Madrid. For big city people, the locals in Madrid are unfailingly friendly even to foreigners. Mytec is keen to stress that people like me staying in the city, contributing, paying taxes, speaking Spanish are not the problem. Anti-foreigners sentiment is practically taboo here. I'm starting to see that the locals distinguish between two very different kinds of foreigners. Some come to stay to be part of Madrid, and the others, whether tourists or short-term digital nomads, just come to see it, to get the photo, put it on Instagram, tell the world how great it was, and move on. Our people who directly, the city, they are just trying to convert it in a thematic archive. Just for tourists, you see. We are losing our commerce, our local commerce. We are losing a lot of necessary things for living, but we have more and more and more touristy flats. And it goes a lot of problems because it's just noise, dirtyness. We are losing our roots. And it's not a good thing for living there. Madrid's aim is to get high-quality tourists, coming for the Prado, Spain's National Museum, and eating in nice restaurants. The mayor likes to joke that it's lucky not to have a beach. But some tourists still come for the nightlife, that energy on the street, late at night, that the city's famous for, and not all of them behave themselves. I remember one thing just last summer, it was about 10 in the night, and it was so hot, I couldn't sleep well, and you have the open windows. And suddenly you can hear, son of a bitch, go home and be quiet. I need to get up in a couple of hours. We head out for a walk as she points out some of the landmarks that are no more. There she says, used to be the brewery for Mao, the city's ubiquitous beer. If you ask for una terbeta in a bar, it's very likely you'll get a Mao. But the brewery and its jobs have moved out of the neighborhood. And over there was the old Vicente Calderón Stadium, the long time home of Atlético de Madrid, the scrappy and less well-known rival to Real Madrid, the city's powerhouse. Atlétis fans are devoted, and it was a huge blow when the club moved to a more modern stadium, again, far from Arganthuela. Arganthuela is not as charming to the eye as Chambarí, my neighborhood, and by and large it lacks the glitz in the history of the center, even though it's just next door. But it's a barrio, a neighborhood, just as Chambarí is. And barrio, by the way, is a word beloved in Spanish for the connotations it has of friendship and connection. If Oleg Arganthuela was not especially pretty, neither are the new buildings sprouting up, but they are far fancier than anything that went before. It's a complex picture. Rich foreigners aren't moving here, but rich spaniards priced out from other neighborhoods like Chambarí are because of its close proximity to the center. I'm thinking once again about the city's dynamism. Madrid is drawing people from other parts of Spain that create fewer jobs and opportunities. Who could be opposed to that? It's drawing foreigners who come to enjoy it. Who could be opposed to that too? We lavish pity on cities that nobody wants to move to, and rightly so. But what if by moving to a place, you make it less attractive to move to? As I said in the introduction to this picture, what makes Madrid Madrid isn't beautiful buildings or ancient monuments, but its character, the quality of being, not doing. But what if all that change is turning it into a city that does rather than is? Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone. We're here. We're here. Hello. Hello. Rita Maestra, the head of much Madrid, a left-wing party that highlights the inequalities in the city, told me a fact that has stuck with me. They're now more Airbnb's than children in the central district of the city. But she also mentions that the poor, southern neighborhoods, even Arganthuela, just next door, are relatively starved of investment in city funding. If rich people move there and clamor for services like better education or cleaner streets, surely that's a good thing for Arganthuela, right? In fact, there are winners from the process, and that's important to acknowledge. They're too often treated as the bad guy when talking about gentrification, but these are people who have a right to homes and their dreams, just like everyone else. And the balance also includes people whose jobs are supported by tourism. Madrid, as the political capital, didn't use to depend on tourist jobs as a lot of other parts of Spain do, but now it's an increasing source of wealth. Everyone who lets out their home on Airbnb, or who sells it to someone else who does, is a winner from tourism. But the balance of interests includes those who lose out on the dream too. From our apartment, we could see directly across the plaza to the music school. It was a cheerful looking local place, almost so local that I wasn't sure it was four or four owners like us and I was a little nervous to stick my head in. But my son had been playing the drums in London and I wanted him to carry on. I played the guitar and piano myself and have kind of a dream of a family band. So I asked about lessons for him and sure enough, it took him in happily. The more time I've spent at this place, the more I've fallen in love with it. And the story that it tells is the story of this city. Last July, hundreds of people turned up for a protest because the building is to be sold. The music school, as well as the residents are being told, they must get out. No way of sands or butts when their leases expire. The owners won't negotiate. Why? Everyone on the plaza, dog owners, protesters, the music students, parents, say the same thing. It's almost spat out, Biso Sturdy Stikos, tourist departments, the kind that are rented out on platforms like Airbnb. It turns out that the buyer of the building is not public. Nobody actually knows that it's going to be Airbnb's, but it tells you a lot that that's what everyone assumes, including Nidia and Patricia, the school's founders. They tell me that generations of kids have come through the school's doors. They've even taught the children of children that they've taught. Nidia and Patricia are two old friends who founded this school almost 30 years ago. They came up in the city during the Mojita, the go-go sex drugs and liberation era in the 1980s after the Franco dictatorship ended. The Mojita famously inspired Pedro Almodovar in film, and in music, it was represented by a burst of pop and rock and metal. The music was very good. We liked the music more than the ones we liked the most, but we liked the music more. But we liked the classic of all kinds of things. In the case of Nidia and Patricia, who both played the saxophone, it was jazz. Since we arrived three years ago, as the pandemic was wearing off, to today, home prices in Madrid have increased by 28%. Rents are up almost 40% in those three years, and that would tempt any investor. They tell me the buyer wants this building empty. No tenants living upstairs, no music school. Animal spirits of capitalism, you might think. But the music school represents the best of capitalism, too. These are two plectiante-bernores making a thriving cultural gem at a profit. They continued paying their rent every time it went up. This is in a case of change overtaking those who can't keep up with it. Nidia and Patricia, it turns out, have no idea who the buyers are. Maybe it's not Airbnb tourist departments as everyone assumes it is. It could also be a developer who wants to turn a bunch of old apartments in a prime location on the plaza into high-end rental and sale places. It reminds me of something told to me by Rida, the head of the Moss Madrid political party. She tells me that big foreign funds, which she calls Vulture Capital, are buying up buildings all over the city. Sometimes they leave them empty for a few years, knowing that they'll be able to sell them for a lot more a few years later, and tenants get in the way. When buyers buy up these buildings, they often do them up in a modern international style. Across Madrid, all the renovations look the same to my eye. The developers take a traditional Spanish apartment, knock out all the walls that create a warn of small rooms, and pull out dark wood installations like bookshelves that soak up all the light. In their place comes an airy, sunlit place with immaculate floors, minimalist design, and lots of white, high-end furniture and fixings. And they always include a showpiece kitchen open to the dining and eating areas. Spaniards call it a cotina ame-gana, an American kitchen. All the newly renovated places seem to have them, and list for hundreds of thousands more than the un-renovated place next door. Who's moving in? I hear you ask. It seems every day I hear more American English like mine. A retired American couple bought the first place that we lived in and a big markup. A new hampshire-based school set up a Madrid campus just two blocks away, with tuition fees almost twice the going private school rate in Madrid. You hear German and French and British English too, but it seems to be more of my countrymen than anybody else, making me think again about my part in it. Back on the metro again, we're headed east now to the rich neighborhood of Salamanca, where many of my fellow Americans settle. When you talk to Madrilenos about the change in the city, many of them, like Andreas, my friend from the Wineshop, point to the changes in the city as accelerated by the COVID pandemic. The pandemic was crucial in Madrid's sudden emergence. After an awful initial wave of death, the city and regional governments fought to keep Madrid open, and tourists and digital nomads discovered it as a place where life returned to semi-normal earlier than other places. And then they discovered just how great the city is. Among other things, the pandemic changed work patterns, people who could work anywhere decided to do so, and found places like Madrid and Lisbon, congenial for doing exactly that, with big airports and direct flights to their clients, but cheaper rent and more sun than where they'd left. So who better to talk to about this rise in digital nomadism than the owner of a co-working space? Contalo Navarro, who runs the shed. I mean, what's a city of, I think, was 2.5 or 3 million people, more or less the city, and right now I don't know, it's getting 4 or 5. Yeah, so in 23 years, change a lot. Some of his clients are short-term digital nomads. They may come for just a week or two or three, says Contalo. This in theory is the kind of good tourism that cities want. Madrid attracts almost as much tourist spending per resident as Barcelona does, but with less than a third of the number of tourists. Less mass, more class, you might say. Some of the people don't live here. They are, you know, tourist, working tourists. Okay, how much tourist we have, and okay. But not working tourists for a few periods of time, maybe 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 days. So they decide to come here, leave on Thursday, stay Thursday, and then stay there weekend for holiday vacation. But Contalo says the city can't accommodate all these people taking advantage of flexible work and short haul flights. You can't find, and maybe sometimes in Madrid, so the hotels are full. There may be a surpool, so we need more places to stay, like I say. Maybe we have to start thinking in how to make that places grow. For Maitre, the community organizer, and Rita, the left-wing politician, there are too many Airbnb's. For Consalo, they're not enough. Most of the 16,000 or so, everybody knows, are unlicensed, that is to say, they're illegal. Something the city promises to crack down on, but which hasn't happened yet. I told Contalo about the music school, and asked him his thoughts on the ways in which the city is being transformed. He echoes a sentiment that is also very much characteristic of Madrid. That's life, I mean, that's the way it grows city. We're still having the Romans cities instead of, you know, it's life. Change is a constant, especially in cities. That's why people move there, to start a business, to move up the career ladder, to do something different. A static city is almost by definition a stagnant city, a failing one. And Madrid is anything but that. Its economy is booming, not least because of all these foreign interests. Tourists adding it to their tour of Europe, companies setting up headquarters there, and foreign residents like me making it home. On our way out, we meet Matt Langen, an American expat who epitomizes the optimism and enthusiasm that those who moved to Madrid have for the place. So my wife's half Spanish, I'm able to get my residence card. We're remotely, we have our own PR firm, and all of our clients are in Washington, DC, like government technology companies. Service it all out of here, and I love Madrid, and we just bought an apartment we're renovating. We're going to stay here forever. Matt's can't do spirit is very American, and at the same time, very Madrid. Spain has made itself attractive to foreigners, with a so-called golden visa. Residency permits for those who buy a property for more than 500,000 euros. And the regional government of Madrid has thrown more tax incentives for people with money to come to Madrid to invest, work, and live. The local government very much wants people like Matt. My Spanish is getting better, poco a poco. You know, I'm having a hard time with that, because I work all day in English, so when I get out on the streets, I have to switch to Spanish mode. But I love it. The Spaniards are, I think, the nicest people on the planet, do. They're open, always up for having a good time. I see him pray I want a fiesta. There's always a party. Matt is tall, handsome, and has a good handshake. He's the kind of good foreigner the locals I've talked to all agree that they welcome. He's not here today, gone tomorrow. He's soaked up the city's spirit, fun, and he wants to be part of it. Yeah, I mean, the quality of life is just so much better, man. I mean, the food, the people, the culture, the weather, access to Mallorca, visa, Italy, London, Paris. You know what I mean? But he, and here again, I should say we, because journalists and their families are very much included, also want a kind of authenticity that Madrid represents. As a tourist side trip at best during the rise of cheap travel, it kept this kind of authenticity that's rare in a Western European capital these days. It's exactly what's attracted people like me here, and it's exactly what's changing. The music school is painted in bright abstract colorful images of musical instruments. It's a cheerful facade, but inside, where my son once practiced his drums, the school is now silent. A shell. It's closed. The instruments are sold and nothing is left. The institution is over, at least for now. Even if you don't speak Spanish, you can probably hear the emotion in it's voice. She's saying that the work they put in, the institution they built, this was a happy place, a happy time of the week for those who came. And all of a sudden, it's like it doesn't mean anything. The loss of one place doesn't change a neighborhood, but to lose the only music school takes you from something to nothing. That's one more service people will have to leave the neighborhood for. When you don't have a tailor or a butcher or a locksmith nearby, you can't live in the fabled 15-minute city, where all the amenities you need are 15 minutes walk away or less. Not anymore. Madrid had something other cities are trying to achieve, and that now seems to be under threat, so people can enjoy it for a good time, just for a short time. It's a concern I take to the mayor, Jose Luis Martinez Almeza. He's in his 40s, he's been the mayor for five years, and he's highly focused, he chooses his words carefully. We meet in his grand offices about 25 minutes walk away. He understands the tensions, housing seems to come up in every interview and conversation that I've seen with him. But he's resolute that Madrid should be a welcoming place for visitors. It's difficult and Madrid compete, for example against Paris, London, New York, in terms of economic, but it's easy to compete against Paris, London or Elk in terms of quality of life. The environment that Madrid offers to the people, to attract people, but to retain people, it's that they have the best life here. That's that essential character of Madrid, quality of life, being not doing. Quality of life is Madrid's cultural capital, and it hopes to invest that capital. In attracting growth. But as with every investment, things can go wrong. The mayor, too, says he doesn't want Madrid to become Disneyland. We need to walk to avoid the main risk, because it's true that when a city grows, it's easy to transform one city in different cities. But we're going to maintain our spirit, our identity, we want to share our traditions, our customs, we want to transmit that the people feel quiet because this is a city by everything. When I ask how you get the best of both worlds, he talked about guaranteeing good public services for ordinary residents in every district of Madrid. That's things like health clinics and schools, for example. And he talks about clamping down on illegal Airbnb's, as well as restricting the growth of new ones, legal or illegal. I also asked the mayor about the music school closing, because for me, this represents the worst side of this change, the unfettered side. If you tell me, don't you think there's a music school in Madrid? I'm like, I'm not like that. What do you say about the city? He tells me regarding the music school that as a citizen, he's sorry that it's going away. But as a mayor, it isn't something he can interfere with. I leave him with the news that Nidia and Patricia are seeking a new home, maybe in a space owned by the city, and he promises to make a call, see what he can do. It's relevant here that mayor Almeida is from the center right people's party. In Madrid, this is close to what you would call a liberal party in the European sense. It's friendly to investing in capitalism and skeptical of a state that tries to do everything. Back on the plaza, as I take the dog out, I think Madrid has been good to me. It's been good to mad, the American from the co-working space. It's been good to countless others from elsewhere, from Eva Gardner to David Beckham. But is this city for people like them, for people like me? Does that question even make sense? Maybe a city is, like New York in the old song, for anyone who can make it there. I'm reassured by the conversations I've had over and over when I'm told, and I'm quite sure it's sincere, that the locals don't resent people like me, not individually anyway. But in our numbers, we change things. I remember Andrés, my friend, the wine merger, who, like me, came from somewhere else, but who spent 15 years making Madrid a home. He benefits as a business owner and sympathizes with his neighbors like a local. He notes that the neighborhood tends to vote for the center right business-friendly people's party. He's echoing here what might be a theme of Madrid. The city is for its citizens. That's an etymological connection that's a little clearer in Spanish. Las ciudades son para los ciudadanos. And the citizens are not Spanish passport holders, but all of us who live in the city. I would never tell you don't come to Madrid because I like it the way it is. That would be hypocritical. I came here, and in doing so, I changed it. I wouldn't say don't come to tourists, which I first did decades ago and loved it. I wouldn't say don't spend a stretch working here. I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it if you do. When you hike in Virgin Nature, you're increasingly made conscious of the imprint you leave. Not plucking plants or walking off the trail is more than good etiquette. It's critical to making sure that you don't destroy the very thing that you came to see. Cities look harder and tougher, but they can be in delicate balance too. So if you come to Madrid, this welcoming city, you'll be taken in as if you belong here, almost as if you too are a Madrid Llanon. Be a good one. The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The Thanks for listening to this episode of the Weekend Intelligence, which was presented by Lane Green and produced by Sam Westeran. Sound design was by Nico Rofast, and the executive producer of the Weekend Intelligence is Gemma Nubi. But first... Tonight, with just over a month to go until Election Day, the first and only meeting between the two men who hope to become Vice President of the United States. For more than an hour, it felt like the debated transported us back in time to kind of a different era in American politics where candidates could deal with each other in a largely respectful manner, actually indicating interest and compromise and take substantive issues seriously rather than spend a lot of time calling each other names. But very late in the debate, all of a sudden the subject of January 6th, an election denial came up. And I think that jolted us all back to reality with a very abrupt reminder of who JD Vance is running mate is and what exactly the politics he represents has meant for the state of discourse in the country. JD Vance came into the debate as, according to polls, the most unpopular Vice Presidential candidate in recent American history. And I think one major reason for that is that he has got one persona, a very online sort of trollish persona that's apt to say provocative and even nasty things about childless cat ladies and so forth. And recently his willingness, even eagerness to spread unverified rumors about the behavior of Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, that have just convulsed that town. We really saw none of that javance in this debate. Instead he presented himself as a very reasonable, highly eloquent skilled spokesman for Donald Trump's movement. The four years of Donald Trump's presidency have never sounded better than they did as described by JD Vance in this debate. Inflation was low. Take home pay was higher and he saved the very program from a democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. And he did that by bending the facts beyond recognition in a couple of cases, including when he claimed that Donald Trump had saved Obamacare through earnest bipartisan efforts. When Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and health care costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care. Tim Waltz entered the debate in a very different political position than JD Vance, as in fact the most popular right now, according to the polls candidate out of the four in this field. Although I don't think he's terribly well known. He projects this appealing, evoncular, down-to-earth persona and he demonstrates a lot of optimism energy on the campaign trail. But truth is, unlike JD Vance, he hasn't exposed himself to really adversarial interviewing or much interviewing at all. And I think that showed he seemed a lot less confident, a lot less poised. He got off to a really weak start, I thought, on the very first question, kind of a strange question about whether he would support a preemptive strike on Iran. Governor Walls, if you were the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes. But he looked just kind of terrified by the question and I thought stumbled around a bit and tried to answer it. Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining home tonight. Let's keep in mind where they started. October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1,400 Israelis and took prisoners. Iran, our Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Any often spoken sentence fragments, pronouns without antecedents, sentences, there were a bit cryptic and didn't go anywhere. Whereas JD Vance just reeled off complete paragraph after paragraph. Although Tim Walls did get more sure footed as the debate went on. On the question of abortion rights, I think he succeeded in spending time with the men speaking powerfully about the cost to individual women of the abortion bands that have gone into place in certain states. The fact of the matter is how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography? But is relative, I think, lack of experience in this kind of debate also showed as each struggle to give tight cooking or answers to some other policy questions. And also follow up and challenge some of JD Vance's more fanciful assertions. JD Vance is really trying to draw what I think is quite a false equivalence between Donald Trump's behavior after that election with Woody rightly described as democratic objections to previous Republican elections, none of which resulted in violence, none of which resulted in a real effort. And the courts to overturn the election, Tim Walls did a good job of calling JD Vance on that. This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen. And it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say, he is still saying he didn't lose the election. I would just ask that. Did he lose the 2020 election? Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind and the wake of the 2020 COVID situation? That is a damning non-answer. And I think JD Vance is refusal to answer that question as effort to dance away from it by saying I'm focused on the future. I'm not thinking about the past, a very transparent dodge. He's just a real reminder of how trapped the Republican Party is by the politics of Donald Trump and by his lies about that election. And that's what kind of dispel what had been this very convivial for the most part, debate where we saw the two candidates even on a really contentious issue like guns and schools. They really will find some common ground. When we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence. And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we do have to do better. And I think that Governor Waltson, I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Then they seem very pleased to be finding that common ground themselves. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, it's a warrant and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know they're things that work. I think that that aura of conviviality benefited JD Vance more than Tim Walls. And I think really helped JD Vance project the image he was trying to project. And it wasn't until the very end of the debate really, the Tim Walls, in a sense maybe realized he was letting Senator Vance get away with this and put a stop to it. The snap polling suggests that most people thought it was a draw. I do think JD Vance turned in the stronger performance. Interestingly though, it also suggested both candidates improve their favorability with voters. In other words, voters emerge from the debate feeling better about both men, which maybe that's a hopeful sign that politicians might take a lesson from that and aspire to have slightly more substantive debates in the future with less name calling. I think the reality is that this debate is probably not going to have a major impact on the course of this campaign though. I don't think there was any great triumph or terrible mistake made by either candidate that's likely to benefit either on the one hand or hunt them on the other. Thanks for the. It was never a good idea. It was never a good idea, but it was the will of the people. I feel betrayed and really quite let down by a government that promised much and delivered nothing. I don't think it just worked as well as we thought it would. Don't just stop coming, you know, in the nurses there. We are so down now, it's all in the church. It's fairly clear eight years after the referendum, the share of British people who think the Brexit was a good idea is steadily falling. But doing much about that fact is much easier said than done. The context of this government coming to power is that its supporters include a high majority of people who think Brexit was a bad idea. So 78% of Labour Party voters would opt to rejoin given the chance. A similar as like Labour abortion would like to see a second referendum in this parliament. Now that's very much not the position of the government. So Kirstalman, the new Prime Minister, has engaged in a big diplomatic reset of an attempt really to normalise relations with the EU that were strange during the Brexit years. He hosted a big summit of leaders from the European Union and the broader European content blend in palace and Oxfordshire within a couple of weeks of coming to office. He met the Irish Premier in Dublin and earlier his official residence in the English countryside. He's been to Paris. He had a big trip to Berlin which I joined him on to announce a big bilateral pact. So he's really seeking a warming of ties between the UK and other European capitals. He wants to tweak or change the UK EU deal that was the product of the Brexit divorce. So the centrepiece of that will be a new agreement around security cooperation. He's also looking for a new agreement that would facilitate the flow of foodstuffs between the UK and the EU. It should require some sort of high degree of regulatory alignment. The sort of thing that the previous government wasn't keen on at all. He painted some fairly bright red lines while in opposition saying that the UK will not rejoin the EU in his lifetime. Or will it rejoin the blocs single market or customs union or will it entertain a return to the freedom of movement of people? And those bright red lines which were necessary in opposition seem to persist in government as well. We do want a reset with Europe, a reset with the EU. That does not mean reversing Brexit or re-entering the single market or the customs union. And what is striking to me is that he's not sought to replace those red lines or add to them a new set of imperatives which would guide the relationship going forward. And the fact that he hasn't done that some analysts think suggests that this actually might prove to be quite a limited reposimal. So this is one of the interesting puzzles of British politics at the moment. In that on the surface the polls suggest a growing share of Britain's that not only think that Brexit was a mistake, but it would actually rejoin the European Union given the chance. They are clustered in the Labour Party's electoral coalition. That's a pretty fragile electoral coalition. Stama won a big majority on just 34% of the votes. You need to keep all of that tribe happy if he's to stay empowered beyond this term. And yet this movement seems to have relatively little influence on British policymakers. Now that's partly because the questions are inherently difficult and require the extent of 27 other EU governments and the European institutions. But it is striking that even on things that we know European governments are quite keen on such as increased mobility for young people, such as Britain rejoining the Erasmus Student Exchange programme, there is relatively little acute domestic pressure for Kierstama to sign up to those. I think part of the fact is that amongst the pro EU groups in the UK there isn't a strong consensus on whether they want to go for relatively peace meal improvements such as the Erasmus scheme, or whether they want to be more radical and go for the big ban option of rejoin. What are I detect in the movement a slight lack of the sort of ruthlessness by which Nigel Frage, the figurehead of the Eurosteceptic movement employed when he really was inflicting chaos on the Conservative Party over the Brexit referendum. There is an open question whether at some point you see that similar sort of ruthlessness, that similar sort of focused activism amongst pro EU groups though there's not much sign of it at the moment I have to say. For the Labour Party Brexit was pretty traumatic, there are lots of their voters over it, it was a pretty unpleasant period in which to be a Labour MP. And so many of them are pretty reluctant to reopen the debate and it's a new government. So they're trying the hardest to be unified and disciplined behind the Prime Minister, whether that changes at some point should discipline within the Labour Party and Parliament. A road in coming years, that's an open question. The other big question is what do the Liberal Democrats which were once a very pro EU but have dialed down the rhetoric as they drumwind votes in more Conservative areas of the country, where do they go on this? And also they're a small party but the Green Party has an inductor increasingly ambitious policy on the European Union. They would rejoin, tomorrow given the chance, they are small, they've only got four MPs in Parliament, but they are peeling away voters which, Keir Starman, very much needs to hold together. He needs to hold together his coalition on the left and the right. So whether they can accept any sort of pressure at all, that's an open question as well. I think this is one of the great to be scenes of this government. We spent 14 years studying the interaction between the sentiments of Lee voters on the right to British politics. We now have to focus our gaze on an entirely different segment of the electorate, voters who tell us that they are pro-European. The big open question is whether that latent desire for close relations with the EU can manifest as a form of acute political pressure at any point, and how if it does materialise how the Labour government responds to that pressure. And I really think at the heart of this is whether that fairly defused dispersed movement of people who, with Greperex, can exhibit the sort of organisational capacity and ruthlessness which was seen on the leaveside in trying to drive government policy. Thank you. When it comes to fine dining, Michelin stars are a mark of the best. The rating was originally created by French brothers André and Edward Michelin in the early 20th century. They thought by plotting out the premier restaurants in France, they could encourage motorists into their cars and help some more of the tyres they made. But while restaurants all around the world now cover Michelin stars, a new study finds that they may be more of a cast than a blessing. Well, it certainly does help with raising publicity. The study found that Google Search and Tensity rose by about a third for restaurants that received the award in the month after. And it's particularly effective at bringing in tourists, right? People there, I'm going to New York or going to another big city and thinking where should I eat for a special occasion. But that turns out to be part of the problem. You end up with restaurants with quite a different customer base than they started with. And those new customers have high expectations, which can be expensive to meet. Exactly. And on seeing a Michelin star as well, it's not only that you're meeting the demands of customers, suddenly your chefs have higher demands. They are a huge part of what makes them restaurant like that successful. And they want their pay to reflect the fact that they're the Michelin star chef and restaurant suppliers and landlords also want to charge more for the privilege of hosting a Michelin star restaurant. And restaurants that do when a Michelin star are in a pretty precarious position because these are all the people that contributed to their success. And so if they don't cave to their expensive demands, they risk losing what made them a winner in the first place. No, it's not limited to restaurants. In fact, several studies have shown that companies run by award-winning bosses turn to performance than they did both before the award and compared to their rivals that didn't win awards. And just like chefs, award-winning bosses would like to spend that time doing different things as well, like writing books, joining boards of companies, interesting things for the bosses, but not things that necessarily contribute to the success of a company. And it also turns out that prize-winning books are reviewed more harshly by readers after winning an award and worse than runners-up in prize categories as well. So it's not just bosses that have to contend with the perils of winning an award, but also consumers and other industries find that they see things differently through the lens of a star. I doubt it. I think when something is the pinnacle of glory in your industry, you're always going to want to try and achieve it. But I suppose that's the divide. Are you in it for the glory, or are you in it to stay in business? No problem. Thanks for having me. Hell is breaking loose in Lebanon. We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink. And all outwards must be avoided at all times. The rockets must stop now. The air strikes must stop now. This platform will be released very quickly and we'll count on the two parties. We have watched this week as the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated quickly. It has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon. It has displaced tens of thousands of people. There are calls now for a ceasefire coming from the international community, but the direction of travel on the ground still seems to be towards further escalation. First, we saw Israel move on to a campaign of targeted assassinations against Hezbollah commanders. And then since Monday, Israeli jets have started a big campaign of air strikes across Lebanon, not just the south, which they have been bombing for almost a year now, but also very heavy bombardment in the Bekhov Valley in eastern Lebanon. And strikes reported as far north as Beblos, a city to the north of Beirut, the capital. So by far the biggest campaign of Israeli strikes since the war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. The strikes are said to be aimed at rocket and missile launch capabilities held by Hezbollah. The Israelis saying privately that they think they've destroyed a significant chunk of Hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and missiles over the past few days. And I think that is part of why Hezbollah seems uncertain how to respond to this. It has kept up rocket fire on northern Israel. It has slightly expanded the range of its daily rocket fire, aiming at HIFA, for example, a city in the north that it has largely spared over the past year. It also fired a single missile towards Tel Aviv on Wednesday, a longer range ballistic missile. And then amidst all of this on Wednesday evening, the Israeli Army Chief meeting with officers and soldiers training near the northern border, pulled them to prepare for the possible entry of Israeli ground troops into Lebanon. It's awful for the Lebanese people are in an absolute state of panic. Understandably, no one is quite sure what areas are going to be struck next. There are many, many reports of Israeli air strikes this week that have killed civilians that have struck farms and other targets that have no military purpose whatsoever. The death toll continues to climb on Wednesday. The health ministry said 51 people were killed on Monday, around 500 people were killed in Lebanon. It said to be the deadliest day since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, more than three decades ago. The UN says more than 90,000 people have been displaced, most of them from the south, but also some people from the east fleeing towards Beirut or to the north to places that are seen as relatively safe. There have been hours long traffic jams trying to get from the south to the capital. And this is putting a lot of pressure on an economy in Lebanon that was already in tatters that has gone through for the past five years, one of the worst economic crises in modern history. And the displacement of so many people is putting a lot of pressure on shelter for one thing, trying to find homes for people who are displaced. And then also on food and fuel and other essentials, there have been long queues at bakeries and petrol stations and there are real concerns about the ability of essentially a bankrupt state to take care of such a large population of this place people. I think some of this is still designed to put pressure on Hezbollah. It is not yet a statement of intent. The Israelis are training for a ground invasion of Lebanon. They have sent additional troops to the north additional military equipment to the north day on Wednesday called up two more brigades of reservists. But what we haven't seen them do is anything like what they did last October, for example, when they were preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza, when entire divisions of reservists hundreds of thousands of soldiers were called up and a huge deployment took place on the border with Gaza. We haven't yet seen that in the north. And there are generals and officers within the Israeli army who are very concerned about the idea of a ground invasion who remember the very unhappy experience of occupying Lebanon. From 1982 until 2000, a war that many Israelis would later call their Vietnam. It cost the lives of hundreds of soldiers and it didn't really achieve any strategic aim. So I think for the moment they are still trying to put pressure on Hezbollah, but in the coming weeks and months, if there isn't a diplomatic deal that brings calm back to the Israeli Lebanese border, I think there is a real possibility that they will go ahead with the ground invasion even over the objections of top army officers. There are two key players here and there are two key players you wouldn't expect to want the same thing, but they kind of do and those are Iran and the United States. Iran has spent decades and billions of dollars trying to build up Hezbollah's military capabilities in order to have a deterrent against possible Israeli attack on Iranian soil. And the Iranians are very worried now that that proxy is being damaged and may no longer be that useful. They're also worried that they might be dragged into a bigger regional conflict on behalf of Hezbollah. And so they are calling for a ceasefire and they are also I think privately urging Hezbollah to rein in its fire on northern Israel. The Americans have been warning for months about escalation in Lebanon. They seem to be supportive of the idea that putting military pressure on Hezbollah might compel the group to stop firing in northern Israel to agree to a ceasefire. They have said privately that a ground invasion of Lebanon is a red line. Now we've seen how porous Joe Biden's red lines are over the past year, but they are now pushing a plan which they unveiled on Wednesday night along with France. They would call for a three week ceasefire and then negotiations on implementing UN Resolution 1701 which ended the 2006 war. It calls for Hezbollah to withdraw to the Lytani River about 30 kilometers north of the border with Israel. There's a lot of skepticism that Israel will agree to this proposal that it will agree to a three week pause and further negotiations. But there is now at least a more concrete diplomatic effort taking shape to try and bring about at least a temporary ceasefire. One of the two parties to this war will have to change their strategic goals and I don't think Israel is going to do that. They have said for a year that they want to be able to return almost 60,000 people who have been displaced from the northern border. They continue to insist on that and I obviously don't see any way the Israeli government is going to abandon that goal. Which requires then I think Hezbollah to change its own goals. It has spent a year saying that it will not agree to a ceasefire unless in parallel there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu has no interest in a ceasefire in Gaza right now nor does Yehysinwar, the leader of Hamas. And so that is off the table for the moment and that puts Hezbollah in a position where it might have to agree to a unilateral ceasefire. I think if they did that, they would have a lot of popular support inside of Lebanon from people who are angry that the country has been dragged into a war from people who do not want to see that war escalate further. And it might also have some support in Iran where again the Iranians are worried about the damage that this is doing to Hezbollah. Now whether Hassan Lassar al-Ada the group's leader is willing to do that is willing to take what would be a very humiliating step for him to unilaterally end the war. That remains to be seen but I think if he is not willing to do that then this looks set to escalate further. Democrats have been eyeing North Carolina and it's 16 electoral college votes for years. Over the past couple cycles they've won races at the state level like the governor's race but they've lost 10 of the past 11 presidential elections. But this year it's looking more and more likely that that could change. So North Carolina is definitely a southern state. But if you think about it, it's just a few hundred miles or so south of DC. And there are a couple demographic trends, a couple changes that we associate in the US with states starting to lean more democratic. North Carolina over time has become less white and it's in fact one of the most educated states in the south. But if you compare North Carolina to Georgia, another swing state with the same number of electoral votes that went for Biden in 2020, there are a couple differences that stand out. First, it has far fewer black voters and a smaller share of the population growth has been in urban areas. The people moving to North Carolina are not just the young diverse urbanites who are likely to vote for Democrats. They're also retirees and military veterans who are more likely to vote Republican. That makes the state more of a toss up. Democrats have managed to win governors race many times. But when it comes to the presidency, they actually haven't won it since Barack Obama did in 2008. So Jason, if you look at a snapshot of the polls right now, North Carolina is actually looking like a tighter race than Georgia and more competitive for the Harris campaign than Georgia. But there are some other things that matter like the state's voting history, which our economists forecast model takes into account. According to our data teams predictions, Donald Trump is up by two points in North Carolina and just one in Georgia. But this is still a really big deal because North Carolina has felt out of reach for Democrats for a long time. And in fact, it seems like it was Kamala Harris entering the race in July that put the state back in play. And there's one other big factor that could really help Harris and hurt Trump here. And that's the governor's race. It's a pretty wild story, Jason. The Republican candidate for governor is the current Lieutenant Governor and his name is Mark Robinson. For many months, seasoned Republican operatives have been saying that he's too extreme to win in the state. For example, he's called gay people maggots. He's denied the Holocaust. And he said that abortion should be illegal at zero weeks and that women need to take better control of their private parts. But last week CNN came out with a bombshell report that's kind of changed everything. The report on earth comments that Mark Robinson allegedly made just over a decade ago on a porn site called Mewed Africa. In it, he describes having sex with his wife's sister in extremely graphic terms and talks about his affinity for transgender porn. But perhaps even more upsettingly, he calls himself a black Nazi says that if the KKK would recruit black people, he would join. And that he wished America would bring back slavery so that quote, he could buy a few in a video on X Robinson said that none of the comments were his and called the report a high tech lynching. Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story. Those are not the words of Mark Robinson. You know my words, you know my character and you know that I have been completely transparent in this race and before. But since it came out, his top campaign staffers have resigned and the Republican Governor's Association has said that they won't be buying any more ads for him in the state. So even before this came out, it seemed that Robinson was unlikely to win the governor's race. But Donald Trump has actually endorsed Mark Robinson and it's looking like that could be a liability for him in North Carolina. This is Martin Luther King on steroids. Okay. Now I told that I told that I told that to mark. I said, I think you're better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two. And the Harris campaign has said that they're going to tie the two men together as much as possible in the coming weeks. When the news broke, I decided to get in the car and follow Mark Robinson, who is still on the campaign trail. He's been visiting bakeries and diners across the state. And I went to the Northwestern part of the state to see what he was telling voters. Think about the thousands of people who die just proper just today. From overdose and things like that. His message is one of resilience. He says he's absolutely not backing down that the media is full of salacious lies from 15 years ago and that they're just trying to distract from policy discussions. Think about the dreadful state of the world stage right now. And think about what the news media is focusing on right now. Many of the people I talked to at the campaign stops. And remember, these are people who are after hearing the report are still coming out to support Robinson. They simply don't believe it. It's right before the right before the election. It's coming from the opposite side. And so I just think people are seeing it for what it really is that it's a political ploy. But even if it were true, many of the people I spoke to actually started invoking Bible teachings. Right? These are very religious conservative people. Everyone has made mistakes. Nobody is perfect. And if you do believe in Jesus, it all says that we fall short of the glory of God. We are all sinners. And I just want him to know that we support him because I do believe he shares the same values as I do. Others are just thinking more practically like the Robinson campaign hopes that they will. At a diner, I talked into the Blue Ridge Mountain site. I talked to this woman who owns the diner and invited Mark Robinson to campaign there. And she basically says that she's just tired of inflation and knows that Republicans like Trump and Robinson will fix it for her. We need help in this area as far as helping the little people. People above water so many businesses in our area has closed due to the cost of living, groceries, supplies, etc. But the people I've met on the Robinson campaign trail are probably some of the most partisan in the state. And the Harris campaign is hoping that the more independent types, those who lean Republican, but don't feel strongly, might be so put off by the scandal that they just don't come out to vote for Robinson or for Trump this November. Republicans are certainly worried that it might and strategists that I've talked to across the state are sounding pretty anxious these days. And this is not the first time that Republicans have outmatched Trump. You can think of Carrie Laker or Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. But in North Carolina, this will be a particularly tight needle for the Trump campaign to thread because it's a state that they really need to win. Until he publicly disavows Robinson, Trump might have a harder time getting his messages about Democrats and the economy across when he comes back to North Carolina between now and November 5th. Thanks for having me on, Jason. Everything that can go wrong did go wrong. Being a post-produce of the economist isn't without its dangers. While I was in India one time, a monkey interrupted a very important interview. We're making an episode on the future of aviation and we put one of our host Tom in what I think was the world's first battery powered plane. It didn't go so well. Fire tracks rushed to the runway. Fortunately, he came down. I would have had to find a new host which would have been less than ideal. Oh, are we actually... are we rolling? Hi, I'm Kenoff Patel and I help produce Babbage. So a couple of weeks ago, I did a story on acoustic detection, which is this World War I technology which is having a revival recently. And as part of this, I went to this tiny little town called Dungeon S on the South Coast of England in the middle of a storm, in the middle of the woods, and yelled at concrete dishes. So the original sound mirrors would be disc-shaped walls with its structure. And these would give the military about five-minute notice with approaching air craft, which isn't a lot. So they're not a bit ambitious and designed what would become a 200-foot-long curve sound wall. I'm Claire Read and I make various series here at the economist, one of which was BossClass. One moment during the production of BossClass that made us all very proud was when we'd managed to persuade a reluctant Andrew Palmer to go and record himself on a trek to Norway. We gave him some kit. He looked very worried about remembering to even press record. The producers for this podcast had trained me on a bit of recording equipment so that I could capture scenes from the adventure. I did think I'd do some packing noises which might come in use for later. So get ready for some zips. I'm Alyssa Barrel and I was one of the producers who made the Modi varnish. We traveled around India following in the footsteps of Narendra Modi and we ended up in Amnabhad, which is in Goodrard. And we tracked down Modi's tailor because Modi is renowned for the clothes that he wears. Jatinra Chahan is a tailor in Goodrard, a state in the west of India. Narendra Modi started getting his clothes made at Chahan's shop more than 30 years ago. Back then, Chahan had just one small store and Modi needed everyday cotton outfits. Things have changed since then. I'm Dasha, I make money talks to the economist's business and finance podcast. Just recently actually we made a two-part series on the business of Taylor Swift. And it's fair to say that the choice of topic didn't go down so well with all the hosts. So Tom, how was it hearing Taylor Swift's song for the first time? Yeah, they're all right. Were you psyched for our second episode on Taylor Swift? John Fulnaymore, or just first name, Fulnay, okay. My name's Harriet Noble, I make checks and balance which is our weekly podcast about US politics. And for a few months this year I got to work on our mini series Boom, which was about how the generation born in the 1940s has held such a tight grip on US politics. One woman really stood out to me, her name was Margot Alexander. She'd been a student protester in the 1960s, risen to the top of all streets by the 80s which was super rare for a woman at that time. I was co-head of trading and they all sat in a big horseshoe, the traders and the salesman. And you would hear the tingle tingle tingle of a boom box. So some four women would come in. Go to the middle of the floor, put down the boom box and strip. My name is Jihau Chen, I'm a drum tower producer with the economist. Add the economist, why do I say with? Ah! One of my standout moments from this year's drum tower was an episode on second marriages. Our host David Renny, ventured to a dating corner at the people's park in Chongqing where he met this 44 year old lonely man Mr Wu looking for love. So Mr Wu, he's this skinny guy of 44. He was wearing like a clean shirt and clean trousers. But you know when you can tell it's kind of like someone's best shirt and best trousers. Yeah. And he was standing near a big suitcase and I had this horrible feeling that that was all his possessions. And he told me that he doesn't actually have a home, he doesn't have a job and he's from a really poor village in Anhui province. And he has never been married. Okay, so I am Sam Westren and I'm a producer on the weekend intelligence. One of the highlights for me was going to Cambodia to document the return of some objects which have been stolen from the country and had wound their way into the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. And we had gone there for a repatriation ceremony. And it's quite an incredible moment, a really busy room filled with politicians and dignitaries as monks were basically chanting and praying for these objects which had been ripped out of temples across the country. In Cambodia a lot of these are considered as actual gods so it was a very surreal experience to be in that room. you So one of the areas that we looked at, sort of one of the simplest areas I guess, is public opinion. Our people's views on these sort of walk topics changed through time. We took several long run surveys. So once from Pew, once from Gallup, the general social survey and you gov, which asks groups of Americans questions about their opinions on different issues surrounding these sort of walk topics. So here again, we really had to sort of think about how we were defining wokenness. One of the questions we looked at was really more about sort of how concerned people are about race relations or racial injustice, which in itself is not wokenness, but it's sort of a concept that is maybe tied to it. We looked to questions about whether Americans think that white people have advantages that black people don't or so-called white privilege. And we looked at whether people agreed with measures, sort of illiberal measures to, say, discriminate positively in favor of black people to try and balance racial outcomes. What we found was that across many of these different questions, there was this general increase in people's walk views between 2015 and 2021, 2022. And since then, it started to decline again. A lot of these long run questions were focused on race, like those I've just mentioned there, but there were other questions we looked at too, for example, questions about people's views about women or people's views on trans rights. What we found was that the questions about women, they're tended to be a peak in these sort of more woke views a little earlier in time than the peak for race. And for trans rights, the questions tended not to be so long running. They've not been asked for such a long period of time. But what we found is that, say, for example, the share of people who believe that someone's sex can be different from that, which was assigned at birth, peaked in around 2015, which was when the question first started and has declined ever since. We did, yes. We took a list of woke words. So these were things like microaggression, oppression, white privilege, intersectionality. In the end, we had about 150 of them. So with the help of an academic David Rosado, who's based in New Zealand, we looked at the number of times that these woke words were used in six different publications. So those were the New York Times, New York Post, LA Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Times, and Washington Post. What we found is that in pretty much all of those publications barring the LA Times, the use of these terms really started to increase in the sort of 2015 kind of time, peaked around 2019 to 2021 and has since really decreased by quite a lot. So the term white privilege, for example, in the New York Times in 2021, it was used around two and a half times per million words, but by 2023, that had fallen to 0.4 times per million words. So really quite a big decrease in the use of these terms. We also found largely the same trend in television media as well, where we applied the same method and also in book titles as well. So in each of them, again, we see the same broad pattern that walkness is in decline, but for both of them, the sort of nuances are slightly different. So in academia, again, we counted this frequency of walk words in social science papers. Again, we found a peak in 2022. And we also looked at two databases of attacks on academics. So this is cases where academics are maybe there's calls for their talks to be canceled or calls for them to be disciplined by their institution because of their views or because of something that they've written or something that they've said. And in both of these databases, again, we saw that there was a peak in instance around 2020, 2021, which then declined, as then declined in the last couple of years. Academia, I would say the peak sort of seems to have been a little bit later than in the media and in public opinion, but interestingly in the corporate world, sort of slightly earlier, the peak. So in the corporate world, we looked at several different measures again. One of them was mentions of DEI, so that's diversity, equity and inclusion in earnings calls. Maybe unsurprisingly, before the merger of George Floyd in 2020, there were virtually no mentions of DEI in company earnings calls. Then after George Floyd's death, they really spiked. So in the first quarter of 2021, the mentions of DEI were around 14 times higher than they were before Floyd's death. Now in the second quarter of 2024, there's only around as fifth as many as there were at the peak, but there still come considerably higher than they were before 2020. So in the corporate world, really, the rise in volcanism really was in response to George Floyd. And since then, there's really just been a big drop off. So one was breaking down some of the public opinion data by race and also by political leaning. We found that in the sort of peak of walkness between 2019 and 2022, that white Democrats were actually more likely than black people to think that racial differences were due to discrimination. And that was the case for several of these types of questions. It really seemed like white Democrats really cared more about these issues than black people did, which was pretty surprising to me. And the other interesting thing was young people. So I think that the perception is that Gen Z and millennials are really sort of the most walk. And that is what we found in our data, in a lot of these questions. But what we found is that in recent years, they are the ones who've also seen the sort of steepest drop in walkness as well. Again, they still are sort of more woke than older people, but their views on these walk topics are moderating even more than other groups are. The first grade of awokenings was in the 1920s to the 1930s. So for awokenings in general, there are basically two factors that predict when an awokening will take place. The first one is that they occur during periods of elite over production. That's when society is producing a lot more people who feel entitled to a high standard of living and to kind of more clout and prestige than normal people. Then we have the capacity to actually give those people the lives they expect. So people do everything right. They follow the rules for success, but they find themselves unable to live the lives they imagined and when that happens, they tend to indict the social order that they think failed them. The prosperity boom of the 20s had exploded like a giant soap bubble. The United States tumbled down into a bottomless abyss of depression. And you do see this in the 1920s through the early 30s as a result of the economic downturns, the aftermaths of the First World War and actually the major global pandemic, just like in the current moment. So the conditions were right to allow an awokening. Some of the first gay rights organizations and movements took place in the 1920s. Some of the feminism, anti-racism, all of these were integral to the first grade of awokening. And things like cancel culture. The second grade of awokening was in the mid 1960s through the early 1970s. And he wore demonstrators protested US involvement in the Vietnam War, in mass marches, rallies and demonstrations. The lot of times when people talk about the 1960s and the radicalism of the 1960s, they assume that the main drivers were things like the civil rights movement or kind of women's liberation or even stonewall or the Vietnam War. And the problem with these narratives, but one is that the timing doesn't work out. So the civil rights movement had been going on for basically more than a decade before the campus protests really started. Things like stonewall didn't kick off until after the awokening was already well underway, second wave feminism, same thing, the track was being laid but didn't really take off. So I heard you in the book, there were two issues. One of them, it was a tough market for knowledge economy professionals. Knowledge economy professionals were increasingly under employed and we're seeing lowered wages and things like this as a result of broader economic shifts. And so they were already discontented. I have today ordered to Vietnam the air mobile division and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength from 75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately. But then the Johnson administration changed the draft rules such that people who were in college were no longer automatically exempt from the draft but instead they had to meet certain performance standards and a certain number of people would be pulled into the draft pool and all of this. I did not find it easy to send a flower of our youth, our finest young man into battle. And this is when the protests started. It wasn't because of the Vietnam War itself which had been going on for a decade. Before that time in college students were perfectly happy to let the war play out without protests as long as they didn't have to fight that combined with the economic downturn that people like them were experiencing were the big things that drove the awakening in that period. And the awakening ended in that period when the economic situation improved a little bit and Nixon ended the draft. All of a sudden the student protesters were just fine. The third grade of welcoming occurred in the late 80s to early 90s and was a little shorter than the others. More ripoffs, the savings and loan scandal could cost half a trillion dollars but in Washington the big question still is who gets the blame. The proximal cost were a number of economic crises like the saving and loan scandal. There was a deep recession for a period and layered on top of that were a number of shifts to the global economy after the 1960s that led to a lot of corporations engaging in mergers and downsizing and eliminating kind of mental management jobs. There were changes to the immigration system in the United States that allowed a lot of high skilled workers to come to the United States. Anyone from any corner of the earth can come to live in America and become an American. These workers were under bidding traditional knowledge economy workers and so you could see the wages for these professionals were actually going down their job security was going down. The value added for their degrees was going down and so these are some of the drivers that contributed to the third grade of welcoming which was the last time we had these major blow-ups about PC culture they called it at the time instead of walkness but again the contours were basically the same. the word woke alone depending on your audience everyone seems to have an opinion on it but I hadn't really properly looked at the data and because the excesses tend to get all of the attention I was just very keen to just see if we could actually take a pulse you see where is this thing now where was it before and you know whether the headlines are actually correct I think the excesses tend to get so much to be the attention that it can be hard to know how prevalent work news actually is at any given time so that was kind of my starting point of my interest one that's certainly captured my attention was this concept called race to dinner which is run by two women of colour Syra Ryo and Regina Jackson who would gather a group of paying white women to talk to them about racism but as they would freely admit themselves this isn't just any kind of dinner this is sort of a really quite a hostile dinner and I think the methods deployed there for me capture kind of peak workness a lot of it seems to be quite performative on the part of the paying guests so it's very much liberal women who are falling over themselves to show how what they are and you know it takes the form of sort of raising their hands to say you know I am a racist accepting many of their thoughts make them a white supremacist etc but you know the other kinds of things if we talk about excesses for me it's the liberal stuff so it's both telling people what language they can and can't use whether that's in the workplace or whether that's in public or cancelling speakers or trying to cancel speakers but also employers I think taking the wrong lesson from spotting that there are unequal outcomes by trying to sort of artificially change to things like forced quotas affirmative action I think again I see those as excesses starting from a good place which is oh we have these really unequal outcomes why might that be you know the good lessons are to look at are there any barriers in place that are stopping certain groups from progressing here the bad lesson is let's just hire lots of people from one group let's artificially basically bring in more people of those numbers that's the sort of stuff I see as the obvious in a decade how it really changed the country but from you know I was sort of first draft of history I'd say on the positive sides awareness has clearly increased right and you know that's what workness originally meant before it became a very loaded term it's just awareness of injustices so I think it's indisputable that awareness of injustices and of inequities and of the fact that different people might be having different experiences has clearly increased and I think that myself is a very good thing and just to show one example we know that more employers now have put methods in place to evaluate job candidates or job performance in a way that it's just less prone to bias right so just blanking out a name for example it is very simple so I think awareness has has increased and at its best that has led to efforts to just you know make sure everyone has a legal shot another good thing I would point to is civility at its worst I think workness creates a culture where people are afraid to speak their minds or afraid of reprisals and you know that has happened like that's certainly something that I think sits in the negative bucket but at its best I think it's meant that people and workplaces have become a bit more civil in fact a report came out last week by Leaning and McKinsey that showed that across all groups including white men I should say fewer people now report for example being spoken over or interrupted in the workplace another example I've often heard from black women is that fewer people now touch their hair which sounds like a small thing but it's actually not and I'm sure like awkward conversations have had to happen to get to that place but I think that's probably a good thing so there are definitely good things that have come out of it I think on the less good side it has as with any excess you know it has also alienated people and I think particularly the focus on groups and and and hitting groups against each other has had very negative effects you know there's a lot of feelings of facility of like if you're not in this group you know you're either a victim or a oppressor I don't think that's been particularly healthy for the country and you know one can only hope that in this next stage whatever we want to call it there'll be a bit more room for common ground and I'm quietly hopeful that that's possible and Sasha where do you see this movement going from here I think where it goes next will partly depend on the result of the election and it will partly depend on what happens with Gen Z on the election you know it's tempting to think well if Donald Trump wins then surely that's the end of work but he's sparked the last wave so I really don't think it's a stretch to see how if he were re-elected in response to his anti-workeness you can see resurgence I think Gen Z is actually the over the longer term the more interesting question of as any youngest generation they certainly hold the most woke views and there's just a question if like previous generations they will how far they will moderate as they enter positions of power which is not that far away right they're not the ones running those companies yes but they will be and I think those who sort of think that this woke peak might sort of be a false peak like a peak before the real peak warn that Gen Z is much more woke than previous generations I don't know the answers to that I would say that actually yes they're more woke than millennials with everyone else they have actually dropped quite significantly again over the last two years and previous generations suggest as people you know become enter middle age and have kids and jobs and cars they tend to moderate they've used quite a bit but we'll have to wait and see just how much The Economist Yes, I'd moved there a couple of months before with my family. We were working up at half past six with sirens, with alerts from the government. We went to our bombshelter, which we had in the basement of our house, with our children. And we spent the rest of that day and that night going in and out of the bombshelter. There was talk of whether terrorists had infiltrated the rest of Israel, that there were still people on the loose, which obviously in southern Israel was the case. It wasn't in Tel Aviv. And it was a very scary and uncertain day. I'm not sure anyone was aware of exactly what the consequences were going to be. I think for me watching on October 7th, it was clear that there was going to be a war in Gaza in Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. And that this would be a conflict unlike anything that we had seen in the almost 20 years since Hamas came to power in Gaza. But that it was still going to go on a year later, that that war would be unfinished. I didn't anticipate that back then. And I don't think many people anticipated it. I remember a few weeks after October 7th, I was in Israel on a reporting trip, by speaking with an Israeli army officer who was trying to draw up strategy for the ground invasion, which hadn't yet happened at that point. And we were talking about how long the war might go on. And his estimate was that it would last for about three months. Even he didn't have any idea of just how big and just how long this was going to be. I was on my sugar, I jumped, I did it! I love what's wrong! October 7th was a tragic but unifying moment for Israelis. The massacre had hit diverse parts of Israeli society, from the people to the people on the border to the nearby working class neighborhoods, and bedding townships of the neck of desert. In the days after, hundreds of thousands of reservists rushed to their units. Their different politics and backgrounds blended in Karki uniformity, and even the government shelved its controversial judicial reform plans that had deeply divided Israelis in the months before the war. But that moment of unity proved to be a brief illusion. It soon emerged that though Israelis were fighting together, many of them were fighting very different wars. From a majority of Israelis on the mainstream, the devastating campaign in Leechting Gaza was supposed to be a relatively short one, aimed at destroying Hamas and restoring security to the border communities. Then perhaps there would be the prospect of a regional security and diplomatic framework which could deliver lasting peace. But a significant majority in the religious right, crucially holding the balance of power in government saw the war as a God-given opportunity to restore permanent Israeli presence in Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there. As the war dragged on, that divide between Israelis was embodied in an increasingly acrimonious debate over a possible ceasefire. This was Netanyahu's year of sabotage. He torpedoed the deal. The ceasefire supporters yearned for the release of a hundred hostages still held in Gaza, whose pictures and names could be seen in posters on every street in Israel. And then there were those who favor the war going on indefinitely until Hamas was totally obliterated even if it came at the expense of the hostages. And then there was a third war, the personal war of political survival being waged by Netanyahu. As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side. The Prime Minister was seen by Moses Reyes as responsible for a policy of containment of Hamas that enabled it to arm and prepare for the October 7 attack. But Netanyahu refused to bear any responsibility blaming others for his failures and promising Israelis a vague total victory. Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won for our sake and for the sake of the peace and security of the entire world. He brazen out the pressures at home and from the Biden administration abroad to accept a cease-firing Gaza. Towards the end of the year, a second front escalated, this time against Hisbalah on Israel's northern border with Lebanon. And then a third front, an exchange of long-range air and missile strikes between Israel and far away Iran and Yemen. The new wars have all but pushed Gaza off the Israeli agenda. A year on from October 7, Israel is still a drift without greed war aims or a clear strategy for any of its multiple wars. Stuck between its national tragedy and the personal agenda of the man who claims to lead it. I think the options are getting more and more complicated as this conflict expands. For most of the past year, everyone has seen the road to a cease-fire in Lebanon, the road to calm on other fronts as running through Gaza, starting in Gaza. And that depended entirely on Netanyahu and his unwillingness to make a deal less teaps at the far right members of his coalition. But I think now given that there is this escalating Israeli war in Lebanon, given that there is this direct conflict between Israel and Iran, it's a bit harder to see how a cease-fire in Gaza unlocks peace on those other fronts. The deal now has much further reaching goals in Lebanon than it did a few months ago. It's looking to impose some sort of cost and some sort of deterrence on Iran. And it doesn't accomplish those things by making a deal in Gaza. And so I think these multiple conflicts that were all linked for 11 months or so might have become unlinked now. And that's going to make it much harder to find off ramps with any of these conflicts. I think that what's striking over this year is how much attention has been focused on Netanyahu. There's been a sense that he is one of the big obstacles to peace and holds the power to bring the war in Gaza and the wider conflict to an end. And I think that as Greg says, it has become a lot more complicated. But it's also true that in the unlikely event of an election and Netanyahu losing his position, which also isn't guaranteed. It's not true that suddenly this becomes simple and Israel has gifted a government that is coherent and wants to bring the fighting to an end. So I think although Netanyahu certainly holds much of the responsibility of what has happened this year, it's also a mistake at this point to assume that getting rid of him would suddenly lead to peace. I think that's quite complicated as well. Israel's reputation has clearly taken an enormous hit this year. I mean you've got its leaders facing accusations of war crimes. You've got allies such as Britain and France suggesting that they should be limiting the arms that they are selling to Israel. But I think what is really striking actually at this point is that America, which is far and away, Israel's greatest ally, is still very much close to Israel. It has, despite all of the warnings, despite all of the pressure to limit the fighting in Gaza, to refrain from invading Lebanon, to avoid escalating a conflict in Iran, Israel has done all of these things and there have been very few consequences for it, for ignoring the entreaties of the American government to limit its responses. Why on that one? Here, you can see the fence now, this is the border. This is where we put helmets on. The level of destruction is pretty complete. I mean, thinking about coming back into Gaza, say, after the war in 2014, there were neighbourhoods like Shajahia on the border, on the eastern border. That were very, very badly hit, but they were still sort of recognisable as what they were. You can see where the streets were, where the apartment blocks were. Here, it's just sort of very organised and complete destruction, where on both sides of the road, what you see is just piles of rubble. I think the fact that nothing has changed. The humanitarian situation hasn't markedly changed. Or if anything, it's gotten worse. We were there to look at this peer that the Americans had built off the coast of Gaza, which was supposed to receive aid deliveries. That peer was dismantled just a couple of weeks after we went to visit, because it wasn't able to withstand the rough seas in the Mediterranean. And since then, the flow of humanitarian aid in Gaza has fallen even further. There's less and less aid trucks coming in each day. It feels as if the war has just ground into this month's long stalemates, and it has had awful, awful consequences for almost two million people who have been displaced now for almost a year in miserable conditions. I think as you would expect, that response is in large part one of despair. I think that what has happened has both strengthened their sense of identity, their sense of the urgent need for a Palestinian state, their sense of themselves as a people. I think that has been true both within the Palestinian territories and among the Palestinian diaspora. But I think it has also created a sense of hopelessness, a question of how that can possibly ever be the case in the current situation. As Greg says, this war has ground on for a year. It is very hard to see how either side gets out of it. It's very hard to see much desire or impetus from those in power to reach any kind of just settlement. So I think that for many Palestinians, this is a moment where they really have to ask and where they are asking, what can we do next in order to try and create this country that we have been longing force for so many decades? And that has been the entire history of this conflict. I mean, every time there is some round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, the warning is always that it's going to create the next generation of militants. I think if you look at Gaza, there's been an interesting dynamic based on the very limited polls that we can see. And obviously it's a very difficult place to do polling, but Hamas' popularity in Gaza has collapsed over the past year where there are so many people who blame it for dragging the territory into a war that Hamas could not possibly hope to win. And so I'm sure Hamas is trying to recruit a new generation of militants to replace those who have been lost over the past year, but it's doing so at a time when even though there is this rage, even though there are hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza who have lost loved ones or lost their homes, they're also angry at Hamas. And so the politics of it in Gaza are somewhat complicated, whereas the politics of it in the West Bank arguably are a bit more straightforward people there are putting their support behind Hamas based on polls because they see it as a group that is fighting Israel and they're not obviously enduring the worst of the consequences of this past year. This is Dahia, the sprawling southern suburbs of Beirut. It's known as a hisbola stronghold. Normally, it's crowded, but more than 700,000 residents have fled. A few remain or are back checking out the damage. For the past few weeks, it's been the center of Israel's campaign of airstrikes on Lebanon. And it's where late last month Israel assassinated hisbola chief, Hassan Azrallah. The booms of airstrikes have become a regular fixture of life in Beirut, a part of the city's soundscape, like the non-stop honking of car horns. That does not mean people aren't scared. Hussein Zain is 52. He lives here in Dahia and remained. He didn't want to flee. He says innocent people are suffering because Israel is not just targeting hisbola. It's killing Lebanese civilians. In Lebanon, there are no sirens to alert people of incoming missiles, no bunkers for people to hide in, and certainly no air defense. I heard the strike that killed Nasrallah from my apartment in West Beirut. My windows shook, and people in the neighborhood rushed to the rooftops to get a glimpse of what was happening. Since the attack, thousands of people have flocked to my relatively safer neighborhood. The other days I waited in line at the bakery on my street, I noticed a man covered in scars, his left hand was missing, and the stump was bandaged. His face was covered in cuts. And his thick southern Lebanese accent suggested he was one of the thousands of people injured in the Pager attacks last month. Lebanon's modern history has been racked by a series of political assassinations. But what might Nasrallah's killing mean for Lebanon? Ronnie Chatta's father Mohammed was assassinated in 2013. He had been an advisor to the Prime Minister, but Chatta says this killing may stand out. And it's going to leave an impact for sure. But I think it's less compared to anyone in Lebanese history, and more in line with maybe the end of something Iran built, something that maybe lasted post expiration. Meaning, hezbollah. In a shelter in the southern city of Saida, a man displaced from the border villages named Zain says that if Israel's war on Lebanon morphs into an occupation, it won't just be his Bola fighting back. We're all the resistance, he says. I think the question is what exactly Israel is trying to bite off, and I think we're not entirely clear on that yet. I think everyone myself included has been surprised over the past few weeks at both how deeply Israel is trying to bite off. Israel seems to have penetrated Hezbollah, and I didn't expect that Israel would be able to hit it as hard as it has without major retaliation. We haven't seen the barrages of thousands upon thousands of missiles fired at Tel Aviv that many Israeli generals expected would happen if they went to war in Lebanon. In one sense, it has been more tactically successful against Hezbollah, more operationally successful than anyone would have anticipated. But the question is how far it wants to go with this ground invasion that began last week. It has come at a cost already. There have been some bloody battles for Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon. It's also coming to cost reputationally or politically for Israel, not just in terms of its standing in the West or its standing in the Arab world, but also it has, I think, given Hezbollah a bit of a new lease on life, politically this group that had been quite unpopular with many Lebanese, this group that seemed to be quite incompetent after weeks of being battered by Israel. It is now able to, once again, posture as being a resistance movement that is fighting off in Israeli invasion of Lebanon. So the immediate benefits of this ground invasion do not seem to outweigh the costs of it for Israel, and there is a risk that the temporary becomes permanent that Israeli troops wind up occupying parts of Lebanon for a protracted period of time, and that, I think, is going to end up with quite negative consequences for Israel. What is striking with this invasion as with previous ones is the way that the Israelis describe this is a short sharp blow dealt to Hezbollah, a quick in-person into Lebanese territory that will allow them to achieve their aims and then get out. And I think what history has shown again and again is that is simply not possible. That doesn't happen in southern Lebanon, in Lebanon, between Israel and Hezbollah. Yes, last week we saw Iran firing directly on Israel. For the second time, the previous attack in April was after Israel had bombed Iran's embassy compound in Damascus. And at that point, there was a real fear that things were going to escalate far, but that managed to be contained. Now there is little, I think, doubt that Israel is very eager to respond to Iran with far greater magnitude, whether that involves bombing its nuclear sites, which Netanyahu in particular has long argued for. Israel could target Iran's infrastructure, in particular its oil infrastructure, or it might target Iran's leaders in the way that it has gone after his Bollas leaders have laid. Any of these could lead to a significant escalation between the two countries, which would undoubtedly have a wider regional impact. It's unfortunate, but you are rarely wrong betting against hope in the Middle East. We've heard at various points over the past year, optimistic plans or optimistic ideas about how something positive might emerge from all of this. There was a lot of talk like that during the Iraq war about how that was going to birth in the Middle East. There was a lot of talk during the Arab Spring 15 years ago about how something positive was going to emerge from that. It would be in the Middle East, and that hasn't worked out. I think unfortunately there are still so many forces in this region that are pursuing further conflict, that are pursuing escalation, that often for very self-interested reasons they are uninterested in diplomacy. I think it is those forces that have driven events for the past year and those forces that will continue to. Like Greg, I am not optimistic. I think after October 7th there was a moment where people thought that out of this absolute horror, out of what was happening already in Gaza, perhaps the sheer level of destruction could force people to accept that they couldn't live with the status quo that there had to be some kind of settlement. I think there was a moment after some of the recent attacks against his baller where it seemed that that moment perhaps could come again from a different angle because Israel was, unlike after October 7th, in a position of strength that it perhaps could negotiate from that place towards some kind of end to this conflict. I think that the contrast between those two things, the fact that we have had a moment where Israel seemed at its most vulnerable and another moment where it seems arguably very strong and out of neither of those moments, do we see much possibility for peace? That's incredibly depressing and sobering. Thank you. Thank you, Rosie. Bye. The Economist China is belatedly responding to the downturn in its economy with aggressive easing. Simon Cox is our China economic seditor, including cuts in interest rates and what looks to be a new fiscal policy that will include help for consumers and help for families, which marks a big shift in thinking for Xi Jinping, who has previously seen complacent about deflation and reluctant to hand out public money to consumers. So it's easy to explain why interest rates have been cut, where there's been a monetary response. America's Federal Reserve, America's Central Bank cut interest rates. And that has removed some of the pressure on China's own currency. That gives China's Central Bank a little bit more room to move. The other measures, it's harder to say what exactly has prompted the shift. It's probably accumulation of bad news. In particular, on the local government side, revenues have been coming in short. And as a result, spending has been curtailed. And so this year, in which fiscal policy was supposed to support growth, spending and tax cuts, we've actually had the opposite because of the unforeseen shortfalls in revenue, especially from land and tax revenue. We've actually had a sort of unforeseen inadvertent fiscal tightening. And that is beginning to really cut through and social services are beginning to be threatened. And we're also beginning to see some damage to the labour market. And that will prompt the government to act. They kind of forward jobs to fail too badly. It seems quite big to me, both the style of stimulus, the form it's likely to take, and also the urgency with which they're tackling these problems. Because these problems aren't new. I mean, deflation's been there for 18 months. The property crisis started three years ago. And people have been surprising a bit baffled by the reluctance to act more decisively. I think in the early years, there was a view that some of these problems were contained localized transitory. More recently, I think there's just been a fear that it'll be too expensive to deal with these problems, but actually allowing them to fester is more costly than anything else. And the style of stimulus helping consumers directly is not something that sits comfortably with a party that sees itself as austere, self-sacrificing, in pursuit of larger national goals, and helping people indulge themselves and gratify their consumer desires doesn't fit. So neatly with that broader ideological mindset, they would rather be spending this money on 5G towers or fancy facilities for manufacturing. So cash payments is something that reportedly Xi Jinping has been quite resistant to. He doesn't like the idea of just posting checks to consumers for them to spend really nearly. There's a strain of fiscal conservatism that runs to China's Communist Party. He also worries that expanding a welfare state to early in China's development will breed laziness and will breed welfare dependency. And what's perhaps most exciting about it is this idea that they would provide handouts not to everybody, but to families that have two or more children and you would get one check per kid above your first. And so this may be one way to disguise a stimulus as achieving a greater national goal of raising China's birth rate and offsetting some of its demographic decline. Ever since the press conference in which the central bank flanked by two financial regulators, said it would introduce these two facilities to help companies buy back their own shares and to help various institutional investors to borrow funds to invest in the stock market, that has been a starting point for a remarkable stock market rally shares raising upwards both on the mainland and in Hong Kong. This is a slightly peculiar policy choice. You normally would expect a government to try and support the fundamentals of the economy and to hope that that would then reflect back in the stock market. But here they're really using the tail of the dog to wag the dog. They're stimulating the stock prices immediately in the hopes that that would lift confidence and perhaps dispel some of the gloom that's descended on the private sector in China. Again, we don't have anything official yet, but it's certainly along the right lines. So qualitatively in its design, in its priorities, it seems about right. We should be getting more direct help to households. There's a lot of gloom for additional spending, the old-style stimulus in which you just have public investment in the infrastructure that feels played out. There's also an element of this package that will support local governments that are in some quite tight fiscal straits, in particular with very large debts that are struggling to repay. And that's led them to do things like chasing companies for tax areas or imposing fees somewhat arbitrarily, all of which has damaged the business environment and had hurt the economy. The problem is, that's why it doesn't look big enough. Basically, what we've seen is reports that there'll be a trillion U.N. of bonds issued to help local governments, and there'll be another trillion to help consumers that adds up to about 1.5% of GDP. We probably need something quite a bit bigger than that. I've seen people talk about packages that would be more like 2 or 3% of GDP over two years, something more like 7 trillion rather than 1 or 2 trillion. 7 trillion U.N. is about a trillion dollars. So again, it's early days. We don't yet know what impact it'll have on China itself, let alone looking beyond China's borders. But it's in a promising direction. We've already seen a response in commodity prices. So for example, steel prices jumped after the first round of the package. We've had a lot of complaints from China's trading partners about flood of cars, electric vehicles, old internal combustion engine cars, a lot of complaints about overcapacity. And some of that reflects rather specific subsidies and industrial policies that China has pursued. But it also reflects just the weakness of China's domestic demand if China's own consumers are exercising restraint. You have to turn to foreign customers in order to clear your stocks of excess inventory. If China's consumers come out of their shell a little bit, then that will alleviate that problem. And indeed, one of the programs that China's probably going to expand and support is this trading program, which is supposed to encourage people to trade in their older electric vehicles or their older internal combustion engine cars for newer fancy models or trading their old consumer appliances for fancy, greener models that's been talked about buying smart toilets and things like that, all part of this sort of national goal of boosting China's economy and making it a more sophisticated economy at the same time. Angie, thanks very much. The Fox News decision desk is calling Arizona for Joe Biden. That is a big get for the Biden campaign. It's also signal. More than more than exactly there. But Biden picking up Arizona changes the math and it is the first of the night. Arizona is actually a very recent swing state. Aaron Brune is our West Coast correspondent. If we think about 2020, Joe Biden only won Arizona by about 10,000 votes. So that's a really tiny margin. The state only has 11 electoral votes. So it's definitely not one of the kind of heavy hitters, like Pennsylvania or Georgia. But if you think about what, for example, Kamala Harris needs to do to win the election, if she didn't win the kind of respel the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin, then Arizona could prove incredibly decisive. So which groups will decide the election in our zone at this time? Well, Arizona, despite the fact that it now has a Democratic governor and two senators, is still quite a Republican state. There are still more registered Republicans than Democrats, and there's a big chunk of independence. Now there's one region of Arizona in particular that is going to matter more than the rest of the state for electoral purposes. And that is Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, which is the state capital, it's the biggest city in the state. And more than half of the state's registered voters live in this one county. In 2020, Joe Biden won Maricopa by 45,000 votes. And that is the reason why he won the state. And then there are some groups that will be important in Arizona, like other swing states, female voters and suburban voters, Mormons play an outside role in Arizona politics as well. But the demographic that will be really interesting to look at this year are Latino voters. Arizona has the highest share of Latino voters among any of the swing states. And Latinos are one of the fastest growing minorities in America. They still prefer Democrats by pretty large margins, but in recent years, Trump has managed to peel off some Latino voters. If you think about 2020, Joe Biden did better than Donald Trump among Latinos, but Trump gained among all kind of sub-demographic groups, especially Latinos without a college degree and younger voters. But what's really interesting about Arizona in particular is that Latinos here are swinging to the right much slower than elsewhere. So had Trump performed among Latino voters in Arizona in 2020, like he did nationally, he would have won the state. Arizona is the only swing state that is also a border state. And being on the border has made it a flash point for debates about immigration for decades. And there's two really good examples of this from recent political history. The first is that Maricopa County in particular, actually, was home to Joe Arpio. And he was quote unquote America's toughest sheriff. He ran the County Sheriff's Office for something like 25 years. And he held these traffic stops that targeted immigrants. He was eventually sued for racial profiling. And more recently, he's been campaigning for Donald Trump. And then you have Senate Bill 1070, which was a law passed in 2010. It required police to ask people, they suspected of being an unauthorized immigrant, to provide proof of their legal immigration status. Now, Joe Arpio was voted out in 2016 and part of that law was struck down by the Supreme Court. But one of the ways that Democrats in Arizona were able to convince Latinos to come out and vote for them was by campaigning against this really aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. Immigration is one of the most important issues in this presidential election. But it's unclear whether this strategy from Democrats will make a difference this time around. So the economist presidential forecast model has Trump very nearly had in the state, but the race is basically a toss up. And if you look at recent polling, Kamala Harris is not getting the same level of support among Latino voters that Joe Biden did in 2020 and this could be extremely detrimental to her campaign. Research suggests that conflicted Latino voters of people who still aren't sure who they're gonna vote for still tend to break for Democrats in the end. But it's been a while since Joe Arpio has left office and since Senate Bill 1070 has passed. Young voters in particular won't have those political memories so they won't be voting based on the memories of those policies. And really importantly, Latino voters in Arizona care about a lot more than just immigration. They're voting on the memory of high inflation, on high housing costs in Arizona, on abortion. But if we do stick with immigration policy for a moment, polling of Latino voters in Arizona suggests that they favor both a path to citizenship and securing the border. And in the past, neither major political party really spoke to both of those desires. And we're seeing that change manifestly in the way that Kamala Harris has begun to run her campaign. So what has Kamala Harris saying that's changing that? In Arizona last week, Kamala Harris made one of the biggest, if not the biggest immigration speeches of her campaign so far and she laid out this, really tough on border security stands. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. And what's interesting if you think about this speech in an Arizona context is that Democrats in Arizona have been talking tough on the border for years at this point. It really was, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris taking cues from them that got them to this tougher stance in the first place. I think listening to the speech, she knows that immigration is a huge political liability for Democrats. If you think about Donald Trump's first campaign which he launched in 2015, he manufactured a crisis about the border. But in the past couple of years, he did not need to do that. There really were a record number of migrant encounters at the Southern border in 2023. Kamala Harris was tasked with addressing the root causes of migration to Central America in 2021 and Republicans have used this to brand her as Biden's borders are and blame her for the large number of people coming across the Southern border. And I think this is one of the reasons why we've seen her go on offense and deliver such a tough speech. This incredible turn that Democrats have taken on border security in the last 18 months or so is really an admission that Donald Trump was winning on the issue, not only is Kamala Harris endorsing the Biden administration's crackdown on asylum. She's saying she agrees with making that crackdown harder to lift. And that's something the administration did this week. It's extremely telling that she made this speech in Arizona, both a crucial swing state and a border state. And it's by no means the last time that we're going to hear Kamala Harris talking about immigration on the campaign trail. Aaron, it's fascinating stuff. Thanks so much for talking to us. Thank you, Rosie. Even if you've not read any of the books by the Irish author Sally Rooney, it's likely you've heard of her novels. Andrew Miller writes the economist's backstory column. I don't want to hurt your marriage. That's all. My marriage has survived several affairs or it's all right. I'm not going to be a lawyer. I'm not going to be a lawyer. Marriage has survived several affairs already. Oh, ready? I've just never been party to them. Her second novel, Normal People, became a TV series a couple of years earlier in 2020. Yeah. Yeah, you too. Intermetso Rooney's fourth and latest novel was published at the end of September. Lots of its themes and motifs will be familiar to her many worldwide fans. Once again, she chronicles the friendships and romances of millennials with a grave moral seriousness and quite a lot of sex. You could call her style Jane Austen in modern Ireland with a dash of SNM. But I think in this book, her best, Rooney has broken free of the creative trap that literary success of the kind she's enjoyed can set. Intermetso is the story of Ivan and Peter Kubik. Ivan is a 22-year-old socially awkward chess whiz who falls in love with an older woman, Margaret, she's 36 and she's recently escaped from an alcoholic husband. Peter is a decade older than his brother, Ivan. He's a barrister and seemingly has all the swagger and success that Ivan lacks. He's devoted to his ex-Sylvia, but is also having an age gap of fair of his own with a young woman called Naomi. Like the characters in Rooney's previous novels, Bobby and Francis from Conversations with Friends or Connell and Marianne from Normal People, the characters here are highly intelligent and educated but they struggle to articulate their feelings and so they wind up causing pain when they really want to be kind and sabotaging their own relationships. People aren't always very nice to the people they love, says Margaret, a line that I think could be the motto of Rooney's entire over. Again in this book, she captures the swirl of power in relationships and in the course of conversations, beautifully rendering the rhythms and instant regrets of dialogue. Once again, money gets in the way and her characters long both to be normal whatever that means and also to defy convention. But for all these echoes of Rooney's previous work, I think this is her richest book. Two traumas lie at the heart of Intimetzso. One of them is that Sylvia, Peter's ex, has been very badly injured in a car crash and the other is that the brothers, Peter and Ivan have recently buried their dad and grief is a bridge between them but it's also a chasm. The loss is hard on Ivan because he was very close to his father and it's hard on Peter because he wasn't. The main difference though between this book and its predecessors is that the central bond and tension in it is not romantic but fraternal. I think a lot of readers will recognize the dynamic between the brothers. The older one Peter is unable to recognize that little Ivan has grown up whilst Ivan resents big brother Peter's condescension but doesn't want to recognize his weaknesses and vulnerability and the book skillfully conveys that sense of being trapped in childhood roles that actually you've long outgrown. Ivan tells Peter that he hates him yet they share childhood experiences and memories that only they can grasp. And as a reader you sympathize with both of them and hope they can find a way to forgive each other. There's another departure from Rune's previous work. The bits of the book that come from Peter's point of view are written in a kind of staccato stream of consciousness as if grandma were breaking down under the weight of his depression. Now this is the technique pioneered by another Irish novelist James Joyce who was a century ago. And in the best bits it effectively mimics the thoughts and dilemma of a fractured mind. But over long passages I think it becomes risky and some readers will appreciate it more than others. Right as you become as famous and successful as Rune did at a very young age, he's still just 33. He faced a couple of contradictory pressures. A lot of people want them to do the same thing again to write books similar to the ones that pleased so many readers before. And at the same time I think writers have an instinct to do something different and show that they can and they've got a wider range. This is a challenge which in Rune's third book, Beautiful World, where are you? I think she struggled with. And that, to my mind, is the weakest of her four books. But now in this book in Tometso, she's kind of found a way out and that her characters are maturing as she does and she's exploring new areas of human experience and emotion whilst at the same time using the techniques in which she's so expert that made her such a success. And every few pages of this book she pulls off one of fiction's simplest and most magical tricks which is that as you read her descriptions of passion and heartache or drunkenness or rage, you stop and scratch your head and wonder, how did she know that? Intimate so I think is a wonderful book. That's it for this episode of The Intelligence. Do let us know what you think of the show. You can get in touch and podcastedeconomists.com. We'll see you back here tomorrow."

        "text_corpus": " In September 2000, world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York to adopt the United Nations Millennium Declaration. It was the largest ever gathering of its kind and there was optimism abound. The United States, under President Bill Clinton, was one of the 189 countries committing to the aim of eradicating extreme poverty. They made a list of eight targets with a deadline of 2015, which became the Millennium Development Goals. This video from the UN Development Program gives the school card as it stood 15 years later. It was clear that progress had been made and it's with this sense of achievement that in 2015, the leaders of the world agreed to the next set of targets, 17 sustainable development goals. But since then, the world has changed considerably. Governments of rich and poor countries alike have had to contend with a global pandemic, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and refugee crises. In fact, since 2015, progress in improving the lot of the world's very poorest people seems to have slowed. And in some areas, it has stopped entirely. That's how economists and bureaucrats wondering if the modern development agenda is working at all. Has economic development died? You're listening to Money Talks from the Economist, our weekly podcast on the markets, the economy and the world of business. In New York, I'm Mike Bird. And finally, if international development could be done differently, what would future successes look like? Hey Tom, Halus. Yes, I, on the other hand, carry my podcast equipment everywhere I go under all circumstances just in case. I'm in New York for some meetings with Alice and I've got a friend's wedding to go to at the end of the week. Yes, the UN itself is publicly declaring that the two days of meetings mark. I quote a crucial milestone in the global effort to accelerate progress towards the 17 sustainable development goals. Those goals were to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world to improve access to healthcare and education among a number of other noble aims. And they were agreed to by 193 countries at the UN in September 2015. So that was a very different time and in some ways feels slightly longer than the 9 years it's actually been. The first decade or so of the 21st century was a sort of real heyday for economic development. It felt like real progress was being made in bringing lots of economies of poorer countries up the speed with the richer world. But the signs are no longer so encouraging. In fact, some degree they're very discouraging. And in the 9 years since the SDGs were agreed the development landscape has changed a great deal. Yes, it is a mithedly pretty bleak subject matter. And with me now to help explain some of it is Kerian Richmond-Jones. She's our international economics correspondent. Kerian, welcome back to the show. So what took your interest in this subject now? What is happening? Yeah, those are very startling figures. And I suppose if I think of the parts of the world that I cover, people typically associate that the period of time that you're talking about, certainly in the East Asia and parts of the rest of Asia as one of significant economic growth and progress and convergence. What countries, what regions are we talking about here? Where are the places that are really affected by these trends? You mentioned Sub-Saharan Africa. Where else are you looking at? You mentioned the idea of a sort of period of progress, a golden decade or slightly more in the early 21st century, where it looked like there might be some convergent, some significant development in these parts of the world. What are the causes of that stalling in development? So these are pretty alarming trends. Is this all changing how people, both economists and practitioners, are thinking about international development as a whole? Carian, that's all fascinating as much as it's very worrying. Thank you very much for making time. It's always lovely to be on. So Carian's outlined the broader trends for us. To look at how the development aid crunch is being experienced by organizations who deploy some of it on the ground, who better to hear from than the Gates Foundation. It's a charitable foundation established in 2000 by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates. So far it's spent $58 billion US on programs around the world. Warren Buffett is one of its biggest supporters. Earlier I spoke with the foundation CEO Mark Susman. Mark, thank you very much for joining us. Pleasure to join. One of the clearest consequences of the post-COVID shock is clearly on the side of fiscal capacity in some of the world's poorest countries. You've written about the impact of servicing these really significant interest payments. Can you tell us a little bit more about that, what the fiscal situation looks like? So the debt service issue is a problem, but it seems like there's more going on than that as well. So on top of the government bilateral and multilateral aid work, you've advocated for wealthy people to give more of their money away to the sort of causes the Gates Foundation supports. How do you persuade people that this is where they should put their money? As it currently stands, how much would you say there's overlap and competition versus appropriate burden sharing between private philanthropy, government aid and supernatural agencies? So Mark, one final question was sort of addressing in this episode is whether development has stalled, especially in the poorest countries in the world. How pessimistic or optimistic are you in the aggregate on that question? Mark, very sobering answer there. Thank you very much for making the time to speak to us. Thank you. So Tom Alice, I found Mark's thoughts there on the role of private capital really valuable and interesting. There's a sort of strong vein of thought, and not an entirely unreasonable one, that there's a limit to what philanthropy can do for very poor parts of the world. No country ever got rich or sort of achieved this convergence that we're talking about through aid or charity, which is a bit of a truism, but it's important to get the balance here right. So private capital philanthropy can take those risky bets that Mark was talking about. 500 million dollars being spent on a huge test of some idea or some series of ideas is a potentially enormously useful thing for a country and for a private donor to be involved in. It can also be a sort of insane and unjustifiable thing for a very poor government to spend money on, especially a country that's strapped for cash. So getting the mix of the responsibilities right there seems really important. So the years since the pandemic have seen this accumulation of factors that have made the task of economic development increasingly difficult, both for the governments of poorer countries and the organizations that support them. But as we heard at the start of the show, the convergence in prosperity among the poorest countries in the world had all but stopped quite a while before COVID back in 2015 or so. That all points to a fundamental question about whether global strategies for improving the lot of the world's poorest people have really been working at all. And if the whole area demands a sort of radical rethink, what would a better version of development economics look like? And for that, I wanted to speak to Paul Collier. He's a professor of economics and public policy at Oxford University's Blavatinics School of Government and a leading authority on development economics. In 2007, book The Bottom Billion was highly influential in the field. I myself remember reading it at university and his latest book on the topic at the left behind was published earlier this year. Professor, welcome to the show. Thanks very much for inviting me. Professor, I was a little bit about what was happening in the early 2000s that made things then look so different the way they look now. You've identified the change in trends that's happening since 2015 as well. What are these segments of time represent to you? Is this a total challenge to our understanding of how economic development works? I think back to some of the things I learned at university with the Lewis model, the idea of development being a process in which surplus labor from agriculture is absorbed by industry. And this is to some extent a fairly easy process because there's so much labor and it's so cheap. Is it the case that that's no longer true? Was it not true in the first place? What's the change to the model here? So your latest book, The Left Behind, does have an optimistic hopeful side. What are some of the solutions that you see as offering the potential to change the current trajectory? So other than reading about the Lewis model, another thing I remember from my time at university was reading your previous book, the bottom billion, what I wanted to know was what if anything has changed about your thinking since then, are we just further down the road on the same processes or has part of the way you interpret these challenges changed over that period, say over the last 15 to 20 years. So with that in mind with local knowledge and responsibility being so important, where does that leave the sort of development, technology of the world, the global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, what's changed there and what needs to change. Paul, thank you very, very much for joining us. So Alice, Tom, slightly more optimistic tone there being struck by Paul Collier who suggests that the sort of thinking in this area has changed and that they could actually be a way forward. Of course, that still comes down to money in the end and the lack of it. So are you left feeling slightly more encouraged or do you think the sort of dream of economic convergence has indeed died? Yeah, I think that's a good point. And I think it's worthwhile as a reminder to focus in on the countries that we are speaking about here and the fact that there's now lots of countries that are not so relevant to this discussion of international economic development precisely because they developed and you know they became middle income and upper middle income countries. And so these questions simply aren't as relevant to them anymore. But I think in the aggregate, I'm left feeling pretty discouraged. And I guess it's sort of galling reminder that looking at the very broad view of human history development and progress are the exception, not the rule. There's a very rich vein of thinking on these subjects both in economics and economic history discussions about why living standards in various countries diverge from others. And it's easy to become overly optimistic when you do get the success stories and say, oh, convergence is inevitable rather than the slightly brutal reality that it's actually very rare in the long term. And most of the period over the last 300 years or so has been one of diverging living standards globally between rich places and places that have remained poor. And I'm also slightly concerned about what Kerian talked about a little bit beginning, which is the death of big ideas and the lack of generalizable lessons in development. Because while the individual trials and tests in development, economic something that's been a lot of progress on in recent decades are vital and important. If they don't contribute towards broad theories and frameworks about development that can be deployed across a variety of countries, then they're very, very difficult to scale up in a valuable way. That is very concerning to me because I don't really see how you get that convergence without some form of non-specific guidance, lessons, whatever it is about how you do it. Yeah, it's very, very difficult if you can't scale those things up. And on that very cheery note, I think it is time for our statistics of the week. Tom, what have you got for us? There's a really good camera on your phone, guys. Like, you don't need to do this anymore. More brass than cents than as people from my part of the world might say. Tom, may I ask which of your reporters, which of your stories you've pilfered to your statistic from this week? And you've got to imagine it was relatively easy task given that the bank of England at that point had existed for about 300 years. These guys not exactly pioneering the idea of having a central bank. They do you know slightly late to the game at that point. I think 72, which was the low or rather high of the Japanese yen against the dollar this week. That is down very, very significantly from over 160 earlier in the year. Obviously lots of things driving this trend slightly tighter monetary policy from the bank of Japan, the expectation of interest rate cuts from the Fed. And most importantly for you and all of our listeners, it means if you were planning on going on holiday to Japan, you've missed it. You've messed it up. You could have gone when it was 162 to the dollar and got the sort of best deal of your life, but that's now not possible and you should feel bad about it. I wonder what the yen will be at in 30 years, I guess based on recent trends, you know, $500 to the dollar, something like that. Looking forward to it. It's going to make Tokyo very, very cheap. With that, all that is left for me to do is to thank Mark Sussman and Paul Collier. Today's show was produced by Marie Kiworth and Dan Asher. In San Francisco, I'm Mike Bird. First, we hear how the industry's standard practice became so problematic. And finally, we ask if this is all enough to bring down the cost of buying a home. Hey, Alice. Just the two of us today and a special episode hosted entirely from the US. Yeah, I realised that having been in New York two weeks ago, then gone for a week now in San Francisco makes it sound like I'm walking across the country or something. But this was actually the natural endpoint of a holiday for me. So I thought I'd check out whether San Francisco was really back as we suggested a few months ago. And I'll be honest, I have been cataloging without knowing the subject matter of for this episode, the frankly enormous number of realtor ads that I've seen in different parts of the state, even relative to London, Hong Kong, Singapore, none of which are exactly chilled out when it comes to real estate. They do seem to be an awful lot of adverts. So tell me what I need to understand about this. Real estate agents do exist everywhere. I've been harassed by them in the past. What makes them quite so interesting in the US? So on the price of a typical home in the US, we're talking about a commission in the region of $25,000, which sounds like quite a lot of money. So before I go and mock up my own billboard to put up advertising my own realtor services here, tell me a little bit more about how the market works. Why is the commission so persistent? OK, so $60, $70 billion, it turns out this is worth quite a lot of money. The American real estate industry is pretty big and if you take 6% off every sale, that's pretty huge. I think as you may be able to predict from previous episodes, Alice, my sympathy levels are negative at the moment. Yeah, I sort of find it fascinating that America, which is a country associated basically everywhere else in the world with cheek by jowl, very raw market capitalism and sort of market supremacy, has quite a number of these little professional carve outs that seemed to persist. I'm thinking of something like auto sales here, you can't buy a car, direct from a manufacturer in most of the US, which seems crazy to a lot of people in the rest of the world. And this does seem like another one of those things where you have this very, very nice position as an intermediary way. It's not enormously clear that the value that you're bringing to the table is commensurate with the amount of the sort of economic value that you're managing to carve out. There's an Adam Smith quote that I'm reminded of, which is people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public. I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but it is a sort of very interesting, long-running historical battle, which goes into all sorts of industries, all sorts of countries battling yet over how much these sort of intermediaries can claw out of a transaction like this. So the biggest thing that jumped out to me there is the fact that there's 1.6 million realtors who are members of the NAR. So that is presumably an underestimate as we were talking about. There's more people doing the job than a member of the NAR. That is like half a percentage point of the US population, 1 in 200 people. That's the population of Philadelphia to be clear just on the membership roles. It just seems like an awful lot of people. I'm not totally sure how many you need. It's a big country. It's a big real estate industry. But my instinct is that that's too many. There's a famous book called Where are the Customers Yots about Wall Street, which I think a lot of our listeners will be familiar with. And this is giving me this sort of same impulse. It doesn't, frankly, immediately confer to me that because a house is worth a certain number of 100,000 or million dollars that the person selling it should even get a cut of that. But all it doesn't immediately transfer to me that that's the case. If any of you have seen modern family, I'm starting to understand how filled up Dumpy and the core family of that show are able to afford their lifestyle. Yeah, this is extremely informative to me. This has allowed me to update my understanding of the US quite a lot. whether they need to exist at all. Okay, so just flesh out to me again, the buyer's agent as a non-homone and non-American. I feel like I need a little bit of handholding on this. Yes, it's all been fixed in my favour this week. My stat of the week is $34 billion. And that is the upper bound of the price tag of the damage from Hurricane Helene. I've been watching this story thinking back actually the episode that we did on catastrophe insurance and the US and the sort of warp decision making around who lives where and what things are insured from obviously the sort of material devastations enormous, but it's fascinating from a financial perspective as well. of quite a lot of money on this show, $60 billion, as we said, quite a lot of money, $26 billion, write to us at podcastatheconomists.com. Today's show was produced by Marie Kiworth and Dan Acher. Our sound engineer is Ting Lee Lim. And the executive producer is Chris Impey."

Hello, I can't help but notice you are both in New York. What is this, are you having a party without me? Well, it seems like the whole world is in New York for the UN General Assembly in a few days. So I hope you both have made hotel bookings otherwise, I suppose you'll be sleeping in the office. Well, sounds like a nice jolly show ahead of us, Mac. Yeah, agree with all that. I do think there is space for some blurring of the lines between philanthropy or aid and private sector funding in a number of different areas. So Mark talked about relying on the private sector to produce renewable power, for example, and that's fine. But the return on capital for those investments in places like Sub-Saharan Africa is often well below the high cost of capital that comes with operating in those markets, which tend to be riskier. And so one thing you've seen in recent years is governments participating in funds that are structured in such a way that a greater share of the risk is taken by those governments to help pull in more private funding. And maybe you could see that model working in other areas like infrastructure too, for example. And in a way that there is an analogy with what Mark was describing with Gavi. And I think there's probably opportunities for that kind of blending of finance in sources to be honest, elsewhere using different formulations based on how easy or difficult it is to get a reliable return for private investors in that particular asset class. Well, to try and put a slightly more optimistic spin on it, I suspect what we'll have seen in 30 years time when we're still doing this podcast is a lot more variation among the trajectories of poor countries. So places like Vietnam or the Philippines or even Morocco that are being woven into global supply chains. I think should see their incomes rise barring some kind of unhelpful government interventions in those countries. But countries that don't manage to get connected in that way probably can't rely on aid and philanthropy to lift them up to the point Paul made about the reliance of a lot of these poor countries on commodities. I think we'll also see a lot of problems for countries that have been heavily reliant on oil exports in particular. So places like Angola as demand for that starts to fall that those economies are going to have a very painful adjustment ahead. And I think economic convergence for them will be especially difficult. But on the whole, I think I'm slightly more hopeful that we will see a decent number of success stories. So I thought having spent an episode talking about a very small trivial topic, I kind of elevate the discussion. My statistic of the week is 200%, and that is the increase in the price of cameras over the past six years. Now, that is surprising because you might think that people don't really need cameras anymore because phones keep getting better and better. But actually, there has been a massive boom in high-end cameras recently. And it's not just professional photographers who feel like they probably can't be taking wedding photos on their iPhone. There's been a huge growth in amateur hobbyist photographers recently, which is driving that. So there you go. You can always write to us at podcasts at economist.com. Yes, this is the highlight of my week. I have been looking forward to it with baited breath. I can't wait to spend another 45 minutes with you talking about Taylor Swift."

And that was that the average Sub-Saharan Africans real income, so kind of the money in the average Sub-Saharan Africans pocket, is actually not that far off in 2022, what it would have been in 1970, which is incredible. Right? Because at the same time, there have been a billion people in the world lifted out of poverty just since 2000. So how could it be that a billion fewer people are now living in extreme poverty, which the World Bank defines as having $2.15 or less consumption per day? And at the same time an entire continent, because basically beer's poor as it was 50 years ago. And that sent me down this path of looking at what's actually been happening to the ways that we measure poverty in the world today. And what we find is a really startling conclusion. The 21st century has been a time of extraordinary progress on everything from consumption of the very poorest to infectious diseases, which affect and kill the very poorest in large numbers, all the way through to child mortality. But almost all of that progress happened in the first 15 years of the century. So of those 1.08 billion people who have been lifted out of poverty, actually only 60 million of them will lifted out of poverty in the last 10 years. 50 years ago, you're in Tiley right, Mike. Lots of global poverty was concentrated in China and in East Asia. And what then happened was as these countries had really meteoric growth and incredible improvements in living standards. So many fewer people became poor in those places that today global poverty is concentrated in other regions of the world. So Sub-Saharan Africa, but also the Middle East and Latin America and bits of Southeast Asia, not including India. These are the places that were left behind and that haven't grown anywhere near as fast as rich countries. And kind of the concerning thing now is twofold. The first is that they're still stalling and not much that the international institutions have been doing in the last 50 years has pulled up living standards in these countries. And the second is that for a long time we saw human capital gains in these countries and that was mainly about international aid. So huge amounts of funding went into Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly to fund health and education initiatives around 2000. That was all well and good and it's relieved a tremendous amount of suffering in the last 20 years. But now international aid is in recession for the first time in the 21st century. There is less funding making its way from rich countries into very poor countries. And these are reasonably small figures in terms of overall GDP, but they're huge as a portion of funding of some of the world's most important global health problems. A very tempting explanation is the pandemic, right? Because the pandemic was so awful on poor countries. Interest rate rises that followed it, really rocketed the cost of a poor country's debt. Most people who work in aid international bureaucrats, even poor country politicians, just assumed that their tighter circumstances were really to do with a hangover from the pandemic. But the problem is that actually GDP per capita in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and bits of Southeast Asia, hasn't got any closer to the rich world since 2015. That's far before 2020 and the pandemic. So that was the end of a big commodity super cycle, so a lot of poor countries are reaching commodities that were fetching incredibly high prices around that time. And so kind of lining governments and citizens pockets. And even if those revenues were used irresponsibly or they were wasted or there were other problems, that still contributed a lot. But really what's remarkable and what's startling is for how many years in the past 50 years, these areas, so sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Latin America particularly, have been stalling. Their living standards have been diverging and not converging. So this idea that poor country politicians could kind of just wait for things to get better has now evaporated. Yes, absolutely is. So let's focus first on aid, funds coming from rich world charities and governments and how it's used for a really long time. What we saw was that the debate around aid was about how to best use it. So should more aid be going on malaria, bed nets or is infrastructure a better use of funds or should it all be going to desastomification? That kind of stuff and these spawned incredibly angry debates in the 2000s. And now what we're finding is that that debate has been entirely shelved because really there just isn't the money anymore. But there's a much bigger point here and that is that the areas that are struggling, the areas that are stalling that we're seeing, this kind of critical mass of poverty that's become impossible for anyone to dislodge. They are actually areas where international institutions have been involved and concentrated for a really long time. So the IMF, the World Bank and the UN. So there's a real process of soul searching, going on inside these institutions and the economists that advise them. And basically we are living through the death of big ideas and development."

        "text_corpus": " Then, we hear from the head of the Gates Foundation on how governments' development aid money is being diverted to the Ukraine war and housing refugees. Yes, I guess we are actually. We took out for a lovely dinner last night and talked money talks, talked financial markets, all good things. But we are not, I guess, technically having a party together without you right now because we're not in the same room. I've come into the studio in New York because I pretty believe my podcast kits behind when traveling, much so my producers should run. But I did not impose this 730 AM studio call time on Mike as well. Yes, I am in the office of 730, but that does not mean that I kept on the floor. I did make a hotel booking must say not with nicest hotel I've ever stayed in in New York, partly because everything is ruinously expensive. But that's what you get for coming in you end week. But I understand the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly is related to what we are talking about today, which is something you've gloomily built as the death of development. Interesting to dwell on this idea of what kinds of problems do we expect that aid or development money should be able to solve really. Obviously, you would hope that if lots of aid is being poured into a region, then over time that entire region would get richer and economy would be growing more quickly. That's clearly not happened with places like Sub-Saharan Africa, but frankly, that's a vast and quite vague goal to try and achieve by just donating money to a country or to a person. And that then it makes sense that something like the Gates Foundation is more focused on specific problems, things like vaccines. Those are the kinds of positive spillover public type goods that you would expect or hope that governments would be able to provide and they do provide in most rich countries, but it's obviously harder for poorer governments to afford those kinds of programs. And that's where the role for a charitable foundation like the Gates Foundation can really make an impact. But on that bigger goal of sort of how to help countries get rich seems a little more difficult than just donating money. I guess overall I feel vaguely discouraged. It has been interesting to hear this disillusionment to an extent with aid and economic development work. When I was 14, I remember that my sister and I entered that lottery to get tickets to go to live eight that huge series of concerts that were hosted around the world to mark the 20th anniversary of live eight and we went to the one in Hyde Park and you know, maybe because I was 14 years old at the time, but it really did seem then like we were going to be able to fix global poverty with a YouTube concert. Obviously that is not quite how things worked out. I also think this idea that we know how to help countries develop either by giving them aids or development money or by advising them to implement the sort of right bundle of economic policies. That feels just much willier now than it did. You know, the Lewis model or the model of export-led growth. We touched upon this in our services led growth episode, but essentially as the global economy has evolved, it does seem like the strategies that got countries like Korea or Taiwan or China from sort of A to B really can't just be cut and paste onto the next generation of developing countries and working quite the same way. And so it does feel much slipperier to try and grasp that problem of how to help poorer countries develop. So yeah, I guess it's vaguely discouraged overall and not discouraged that you know, we'll never see a poor country pull itself up into middle or advanced income status again. But the way that it does that will probably be remarkable. It won't really be because slots of eight was donated by the never-luck rich countries or by implementing a seemingly sort of obvious and easy set of policies that have helped other countries achieve. But by doing something kind of novel that we will probably remark upon in a future money talks episode if we're still doing this in 30 years. Well, I'll look forward to reading the story about cameras in this week's business section, but on to by set of the week, which is a quarter of the world's wealth. And that was the wealth that was represented by the six men that met on Jekyll Island in Georgia, which is where I happened to be on my holiday last week at a very swanky private members club was founded by the Rockefellers and J.P. Morgan and all of that ilk. And these six men met late in 1910 and essentially wrote the legislation or the sort of rules for the Federal Reserve. And that text eventually became an important part of the founding of the Federal Reserve. But this meeting was entirely secret. These men all traveled on the train down to Jekyll on the pseudonyms and they denied that the meeting had ever taken place for about 20 years until a biography of one of them came out. But yeah, who knew the founding of the Federal Reserve was cloaked in such a mystery secrecy and good times on islands off the coast of Georgia, not be until I went. One of the people there had just been to Europe to like, slew out what the vibes were for central banks. I was like, okay, this is how we should do it. So I think that I know that they can't paste, but you know, we're inspired by the set up bells were my step of the week is slightly more recent and it's 139. Yeah, what was I thinking in 30 years we won't so be making this show we will be running a foreign exchange trading based travel agency that plans holidays for people based on what go into doing. Yeah, it's brilliant idea. Probably if it doesn't exist. Yes, and you can hit up Uniclo and feast on sushi like never before. And thank you for listening to Money Talks. Our sound engineer is Tingli Lim. In 2016, a trader at Jane Street, one of the world's most successful high-speed trading firms, was setting to work building a new model. Most information in markets about companies or the economy is disseminated widely and incorporated into stock prices in a flash. But the firm had spotted a potentially huge opportunity. On election night, most financial market traders still seem to get their information from CNN. If Jane Street traders could access results data directly, by gathering information themselves from hundreds of state and local websites, they could get a jump on the rest of Wall Street. The trader in charge of this operation was Sam Boutman freed, years before he founded the now defunct crypto exchange FTX. At Jane Street, SPF recruited a team of traders to do the hard part. Figuring out, state by state, how local election data was released, so the fund could crunch the numbers before anyone else. It worked. After SPF and his team got results from the Florida Panhandle, they were confident Donald Trump had won. Long before this happened. Their trading strategy was simple. Markets in the US and in places like Mexico had thanked every time Trump had pulled ahead. By the time CNN called the election for Trump, Jane Street had bet half a billion dollars that the S&P 500 and other markets would collapse. When SPF went to bed at 1am, the firm had made $300 million. It's best ever trading day. But investors quickly began changing their minds about Mr. Trump. By the time SPF woke up, a few hours later, Jane Street's gain had turned into a $300 million loss. The firm resolved never to bet on election results again. The story, which we only know about thanks to Michael Lewis, who wrote going infinite about SPF's dramatic rise and fall, highlights the difficulty of trading elections. Even if you know who's going to win before anyone else, you can still lose a lot of money. Investor perceptions of which candidate is good for the economy, company profits, and the market can be fickle. But who are they butch on this time? And will that change, whilst either candidate has actually won? You're listening to Money Talks from the Economist, our weekly podcast on the markets, the economy and the world of business. On my own this week in Washington, DC, I'm Alice Forward. And in today's show, how to trade the 2024 election? First, our own election guru tells us what the polls are showing. Then, we hear what investors are expecting, or even hoping for. And finally, we learn what the outcome of the election could mean for markets. Hello, so I'm not actually entirely on my own this week. We decided to spare you, Paul Listeners, for me, bantering back and forth with myself. So instead, I'm very graciously joined by my wonderful colleague and regular Money Talks guest Simon Remidavitch. Hello, Simon. Welcome back to the show. It's great to be here. And you're not only here because Tom and Mike, ever somewhat, unfortunately, decided to go on holiday at the same time. Well, I'm certain your best will be excellent on this week's shows topic, because as the economist, US economics editor, you are probably the single best place person to help us understand this week's topic. We are going to be digging into the impact that Trump or Harris might have on the economy and on the stock market. Right. Because in 2016, when Trump first entered office, people were still somewhat worried about post-global financial crisis, secular stagnation. Inflation was very low, and growth was relatively subdued as well. And then in 2020, obviously, the economy had just gone through this deep pandemic-induced slump. OK. So with that backdrop, what are both candidates promising to voters in terms of their economic policies? Let's start with Trump. OK, and what about what Harris is promising? Great. So I guess that's what both candidates are promising, although as we will get into a bit later in the show, how much of those various agendas that actually we'll be able to do is also uncertain. But there's a very helpful rundown to sort of get us going. So if you could stick around, I will come back to you in a little bit. Now, to understand how these promises are landing with voters, I want to bring in our own polling guru, Owen Winter. Hi, Owen. This is your first time on Money Talks, I think. So thank you so much for joining us. So the natural point to pick up on as far as the polls are concerned is probably after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. And we started seeing what kind of support Kamala Harris had as a candidate instead. Now, after Biden's terrible debate performance, Trump seemed to be ahead in nationwide polls by about three or four points. What's happened since? And that sort of lead that she has now, you said there's this electoral college of auditor for Trump. What does that translate to in terms of how confident we could be that she might actually win the election? So basically it's still extremely tight. One of the things that investors seem to care a lot about is how likely it is that whoever wins the White House will also win both houses of Congress because that will put a limit on the extent to which they can implement whatever agenda it is that they are proposing and how extreme they can be with that. So with the state of the race as it is now, if Harris seeks out an aerobiquery, how likely is it that she would have both the House and the Senate? And conversely, if Donald Trump manages to e-cat a victory, is it more likely that he might have greater control? Well, Owen, thank you so much for laying the groundwork for us. That was very helpful. So that is what the polls suggest about the state of the race. But do investors agree? And how do they think the policy platforms of each candidate might affect the economy? To answer that question, I spoke to Joe Saluzzi. He's the co-founder of Themis Trading, which trades stocks on behalf of large institutional clients. Welcome to the show. So obviously elections can be a huge driver of volatility in markets. And investors don't always get it right. I'm thinking here of 2016, when the initial reaction to Trump's victory and the moves of the days that followed were very different. Are your clients and are you expecting to see that kind of volatility around the election this time around? Or what do you think is going to happen? Okay. And what is the 2024 Trump trade? And people are expecting Trump to win what kinds of positions or trades do we see investors putting on? And what about Kamala Harris? What are the distinctive things that people are betting on in the event that she wins? And for what you've described, if investors do think that Trump is going to do deregulation, if he's going to put more corporate tax cuts through for firms, is it your perception that overall the market would prefer for Trump to win over Harris or will investors be happy with either outcome? Joe, thank you so much for joining the show. It's been a lot of fun talking to you. So Simon, what stands out to me so far is that just as with Jane Streets, as we talked about in the introduction to the show, figuring out who's going to win the election is sort of really not the only hard part of the puzzle here. There's also the process of filtering candidates policies through the lens of the impact on companies or the market broadly. So that's what they're saying, whether you believe each candidate will sort of actually try to do what they're saying and then will they be able to implement that agenda? And taking a one-way bet on stocks up or down is not a very clean way of expressing that view at all. There are narrow bets that might make sense. So bank stocks did very well under Trump 1.0 and there is a big bundle of regulation called Basel III Endgame, which is currently being hashed out. And there's a decent chance that that would be watered down if Trump would win. Under Harris, I would imagine the sort of environmental subsidies trade, so long EV makers or other kinds of producers of that kind of kit would probably have more room to run than it might under Trump. But the question of which candidate is good for the market overall feels a lot fuzzier than making those kinds of, I guess, targeted bets. do. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, you did hear this in Los in 2016 that, you know, Trump, all he's not actually going to try and do sort of many of his craziest ideas. And I guess he did try, but relatively few of them stuck in a meaningful way. And so it's sort of somewhat reasonable to take that view this time around as well. So we've now heard the view from pollsters and from the trading floor. But for the second half of the show, we are going to zoom out a bit and think about the impact the election might have on all kinds of financial markets. For that, I spoke to Bar New Buweja, the chief strategist at UBS, where full disclosure, I also used to work. Hi Bar New, welcome to Money Talks. I'm very well. Thank you so much for joining us. We are going to talk today about the election in the US and markets broadly. I guess just to start off, if you think about past elections and the electoral cycle in the US in general, how big an important driver of equity in bond markets does that tend to be in sort of what kinds of moves have we seen in past cycles? Okay, why do you think that is? People get optimistic when a Republican enters the White House, but it's not all it's cracked up to be or... Okay. Well, why don't we dig into why you think what you think and investors seem to think what they think? So, what is it that people might be expecting from a Trump victory? What policies and their sort of reaction to the markets might investors be looking for? And just to clarify on one point there, a red sweep is Republicans take sort of all three houses, so that it's the presidency in both houses of Congress. It seems less likely that you'd get a sort of democratic sweep. Is this something that plays into markets, expectations of sort of how powerful any policy package that a candidate is proposing will be? What do markets tend to like from that perspective? Okay, so why do you think that? I guess obviously the 2016 case is it looms large for a reason, which is that I think a lot of people were expecting Trump to be very bad news. And then they sort of woke up the day after and decided, actually, maybe this will be great. So why is that not the playbook that's going to happen this time around? OK, moving to the sort of democratic scenario now, you've sort of alluded to the idea that you think that maybe the initial reaction wouldn't be so favorable if Kamala Harris were to win, but over time, people might re-evaluate. So what is it that makes you think that that might be the dynamic for a democratic win? I also wanted to dig in a bit more to what you're seeing in bond markets, in that we've talked a bit about how Trump might be able to push the fiscal levers more easily. He is promising these tax cuts. I guess at the same time, people tend to associate Democratic candidates with large S and lots of spending, and even if some of that is going to be paid for by tax cuts, you might think that, sort of, underwrite the candidate you're going to see these higher long-end rates. Is that what you're seeing in bond markets, or is there anything sort of pick between the candidates there? Well, Bonnie, thank you so much for joining the show. It's been a real pleasure. So, Simon, are you going to be taking massive leveraged bets on stocks after this episode? Stick all your money on red, so to speak? I must say you can tell that America is really doing exceptionally well when we have our resident Canadian essentially chest thumping about the United States of America. Even you are convinced beyond patriotism, your bigger point that you made at the end there about, well, the stock market keeps ripping higher. So does the market even care? Is a good one to dwell on because I think one of the most important points that Bonnie made there in my view is the idea that the facts that were in a late stage in the economic cycle is more important than the specifics of what either candidate is saying that they might end up doing. It's not that the market doesn't care about the election at all for all the reasons that you sort of very clearly laid out. It's that it cares a lot more about other things right now, like whether growth is slowing, how quickly the Fed will be able to cut rates, the inflation is actually well contained, and so on. And in that way, one of the most interesting dynamics to think about is the sort of iterative effect that either candidates policies might have on those kinds of variables. So for instance, on how quickly the Fed will be able to cut this idea that Trump might have a bit more capacity to actually implement his policies, be it tax cuts or tariffs, and that those policies are the kinds of ones that might cause the Fed to slow down easing monetary policy does feel very important because the path of Fed easing probably is the thing that market participants are most fixated on now above all else. But taking a view on the impact of the election on that path at this stage is so speculative because you're not only betting necessarily that Trump will win. It's that he'll win big enough that he has control of the presidency, the House and the Senate, then he can do policy packages and size, and then that they will have sufficient impact that the Fed will react. And so you have all of these probabilistic events that have to happen before you actually see that impact on the path of Fed easing. So I'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that it's sort of hard to bake that into your view for market pricing now because it's a very specific path. And even if it sounds sort of very plausible, there are a lot of things that have to happen for us to actually end up in that world. Are we really going to be able to read that that's what people are forecasting from markets now? Probably not yet. I guess it does also somewhat unfortunately raise the prospect of more Fed versus White House battles if Trump is successful, which I guess we can endure a second time around if Trump does win. Yes, listeners can look forward to the money talks on hubfries' executor and the capacity of the executive to fire appointed officials if the dispute gets really nasty. But with that, I think it is time to turn to our stats of the week. So Simon, what have you got for me? Okay, 2% of what? I mean, my default is that it's some Japanese bond because I'm trained by Mike into thinking that the stats must always be about Japanese yields. Yeah, when you hear like 2% yields and my assumption is on some kind of government debt, you think Germany, Japan, those kinds of countries, you wouldn't necessarily think of a country that for the last several decades as a bigot through sort of growth boom. My stuff this week is an enduring 50% profit margin. And I'll let you have a go at a guessing what that might refer to. That's the net profit margin if that helps. Probably doesn't. No, in fact, I am talking about Visa, which as you may have noticed has just had a sort of big case announced against it by the Department of Justice for anti-trust. And a couple of years ago when I raised about Visa, I built this chart that showed net profit margins for S&P 500 companies a decade ago and now. And essentially in the sort of top right hand corner of that chart, basically the only two large companies that had profit margins of that level for that period of time were Visa and Mastercard. And obviously, very high profit margins for a very long period of time, all the kind of thing that might eventually attract anti-trust investigators. And that is what happened in the case of Visa, the DOJ start a Vestiating Company in 2021. And this lawsuit is the result of that deep dive. I agree, it is interesting. It feels like there's been a lot of disruption, but in some ways the sort of biggest players in this space are just carrying on as usual. And I think that it's probably all that we have time for this week. But Simon, it's been excellent to have you on the show this week. Thank you so much for joining me. So without all that's left to do is to thank Joe Saluzzi and Bonnie Buwager. You can always write to us at podcasteconomists.com. Our sound engineer is Ting Lealin. I'm Alice Foward. And this is the economist. For those outside America, any understanding of how the US property market works probably comes from the Netflix reality show, selling sunset. It was real estate you can't sit around and wait for the phone to ring. You have to hustle. Yet in a super luxury property brokerage in LA, it follows a squad of ludicrously good-looking real estate agents as they try to sell huge multi-million dollar homes. Why am I supposed to tell him it's embarrassing? I can't say that's a client. Along with the dramatic personal feuds and infighting typical of reality TV, there is the high stakes pressure of working on commission. It's only paid once a deal closes. These commissions are a key part of how the housing market operates in America. Whether it's the luxury residences of LA millionaires or starter homes in Ohio, Realtors representing the seller and the buyer take a large cut, typically 5 or 6% of the sale price. And lately, those fact commissions have been a source of drama. Not on entertainment television, but in the courtroom. The National Association of Realtors, or NAR, is one of the biggest trade groups in America. It was sued in a vast class action lawsuit, accusing it of anti-compestic behaviour, resulting in those sky-high commissions. The NAR lost. New rules agreed in the settlement of the suit have now come into effect. But will these changes bring down the cost of buying and selling a home? You're listening to Money Talks from the Economist, our weekly podcast on the markets, the economy and the world of business. In Washington, DC, I'm Alice Ford. And in today's show, How to Fix America's Reuter State Racket. Then we find out how class action lawsuits have forced a change in the rules. Yes, you're a very long way away from home. I guess you must have travelled so far that you've essentially circumnavigated the globe and are a bit closer to ending up back in Singapore than you were when you were in New York. But what's taking you to California? Americans are obsessed with the real estate market and housing, so is the rest of the developed world. So it's a story that's of perennial interest. And some of those themes are universal. For most part in the developed world, there simply aren't enough homes. Those that do exist are roughly 30% more expensive now in nominal terms at least than they were in 2019 in some developed markets. It's even more extreme than that. But there is a problem that is somewhat unique, the American housing market, which I guess gets to your point about the mass of realtor billboards, which is the problem of fat to real estate agent or realtor commissions in America. So there are a couple of things that make America really stand out when it comes to realtor agents or realtor's, as they're called here. And first, it's that the size of the commission that Americans pay to realtor's is much, much bigger than it is in any other developed country. 30 years ago, on this point, America was not such an outlier before the internet and Zillow or Zoupler, whichever platform has exist in other countries. Real estate agents were so vital, you literally did not know what houses were for sale unless you had one or spoke to one. That commissions were in the mid-single digits in lots of countries. But what you've seen over the last couple of decades in almost every other country in the world is that real estate agent commission has declined sharply, to perhaps sort of 1% or 2% over the last couple of decades. In the UK, it's typically sort of 1% or 1.5% for example. In the US, it has been about 5% to 6% for the best part of a century now, as far as we can tell. Yeah, and the eye-popping size of that commission has only become harder to swallow, as house prices have climbed relative to incomes. So in the 1980s, paying a 6% commission to sell a median price home was obviously a lot of money. It was about 20% of median American household income. By 2022, that 6% commission on a median price home, that sort of $25,000 that you mentioned, is now about 35% of median household income. If anything over that time, you'd expect that technology has made it easier to do the job of an agent, you know, docu-sign and email exists, so does Zillow. But efficiency actually doesn't seem to have brought down the price of using a realtor at all. If anything, prices are even meatier than they were in the 1980s. Now, that dynamic in itself is not proof of collusional anti-compets of behavioural love itself, but it certainly attracted the attention. Both of home sellers who ended up paying these fees and of antitrust authorities like the Department of Justice. So one of the practices that seems to have kept commission relatively high in America is that over here it's standard practice, not just to have a sellers agent who markets the home for the seller and enlists it, but on the other side there's also a buyers agent as well. And these two agents typically split commissions, so if the seller agrees to pay 6%, typically half of that ends up going to the buyers agent and half of that is kept by the sellers agent. But it is a uniquely complicated system that defies explanation and a single answer, so I have put together something to help explain it. A couple of months ago, if you were trying to sell your home in America, here's how the conversation with your estate agent or realtor might have gone. That's Randy Aure, one of the most successful realtors in America. He's on stage at a conference, demonstrating a conversation he might have with a potential home seller. So far it's pretty standard. In countries all over the world, anyone wanting to sell their home will pay a seller's agent a commission for listing their home. 3% is a little steeper than in most countries, but it's not egregious. This is a bit more unusual. Randy is now talking about what sort of commission the seller should offer to the buyer's agent. In America, it was the norm for sellers to make blanket offers of compensation to the buyer's agents to entice them into bringing buyers to their home. These commissions were advertised on private databases called multiple listing services. Only licensed realtors can view these multiple listing services. There are around 500 of these databases around the country, and most of them are owned by the National Association of Realtors. Sellers are free in theory to offer any level of commission to buyers' agents, even 0%. But not paying up top dollar to buyers' agents comes with a risk. The vast majority of buyers' agents behave honestly and act in their client's best interest. But if even a small minority of them steer their clients away from buying low commission homes, sellers will feel compelled to offer high rates of commission. Steve Brobeck is a senior fellow at the American Consumer Federation, where he was executive director until 2018. He's been advocating on real estate brokerage issues since the late 80s. Buyers' agent compensation was determined by and paid for by the seller, leaving little room for buyers to negotiate directly with their agent. The system is one that has resulted in sellers paying an eye-watering 5 to 6% commission on their houses. Triple the level in other developed countries. That fight has been taking place in the courts for the last five years. Home sellers launched huge class action lawsuits against realtors, seeking billions of dollars in damages. In October 2023, the home sellers won. A settlement between realtors and the plaintiffs was reached in March and new rules changing how commissions work came into effect in August. The news ignited a fanfare of excitement, with even the president marking it as a revolutionary moment for America's housing market. But those in the industry tell a different story. Barbara Corkerin is an industry veteran and founder of the New York City real estate brokerage, Yes, exactly, which is one reason why this story has garnered so much attention, even as we pointed out all the way up to the White House, to understand more about the case against the real estate industry, I spoke with Michael Ketchmark. He's the Kansas City-based lawyer who helped lead the class action lawsuit that brought about the rule changes. Hi, Mike. Welcome to Money Talks. To start with, could you tell me a bit about how you came to work on this case? What is the core problem as you would describe it that was sort of anti-competitive? But by the looks of things, that didn't happen. So you won this landmark victory. The jury awarded home sellers $1.8 billion in damages. And it was very clear immediately that the victory in this case was a huge deal and a huge blow to the industry. Then you began the process of negotiating a settlement. So what were some of the key things that you were looking for in that settlement to try and change how the real estate industry worked? And if the changes agreed to in the settlement work, who are the real beneficiaries of all of this? Mike, thank you so much for joining my talks. It's been a pleasure. So Mike, it is worth pointing out that Michael Ketchmark obviously has a very specific point of view on this issue. He is the lawyer that brought this class action lawsuits against realtors and a lot of realtors would describe the situation quite differently. I guess the thing that stands out to me is that I think a lot of these practices that we're focusing on did have somewhat innocent beginnings. Essentially, the reason it is the way it is is that somebody a hundred years ago who was offered a commission to help somebody sell a home or a farm thought that it was a good idea to say to other folks who worked in real estate or property in town, hey, if you bring me a buyer, I'll split my commission with you, which sounds relatively innocuous and kind of like a friendly way of doing business. But that idea has through a hundred years of private databases and policing of rules in the industry become a system which is in my assessment and in the assessment of the trial jury, one that pretty clearly forces people to overpay. And the core problem under the system as it existed is this problem of some buyers agents steering their buyers away from low-commissioned homes. And that seems to me to be the core thing that is really keeping commissions inflated. And what I find so gripping about this lawsuit is that the process of negotiating assessment, they have managed to get some pretty sizable rule changes agreed to. And I'm so interested to see whether they will fix that problem, that problem of sellers being afraid that if they don't pay two and a half percent or three percent, they don't offer to pay that to the buyer's agent that sort of no one will come to their home and they won't get very good offers. And that is something we are just about to get into. But I think it's a huge and very important question as to whether or not they'll manage to sort of shake up that system with, as we mentioned earlier, an enormous amount of money on the line. But what do you make of what you've heard so far? I guess as an outsider who's hearing about the way the industry works for perhaps the first time, do you find it equally shocking and strange or do you have any sympathy with the realtors of America? So we've heard how things used to operate and how that system came about. It's been just over a month since the new rules governing agent commission came into effect. So I wanted to find out what impact they are having and will have on by agent commissions and the industry at large. For that, I speak to Rob Hahn. He's a real estate strategist and writes the influential, notorious ROB substack. Rob Hahn, welcome to Money Talks. So, the settlement included a handful of rule changes for how the real estate industry should operate. What are those rule changes, or are the big ones? And what do they do to try and make this process more competitive? Okay, and what do you think of these rule changes going to have any effects? I guess let's take them one at a time. So first, will banning the MLS from listing the buyer's agent compensation rate will that work? And let's talk about the other major rule change now, which is this necessity to have a buyer's agreement between a buyer's agent and a buyer before they start working together, clarifying what's being provided and who's going to pay. What impact do you think that is going to have on how things work? Could we zoom out and think about the bigger impact this might have on the real estate industry? If it does result in commission compression over the coming decade, how is that going to change the way the industry looks? Rob, thank you so much for joining the show. So Mike, what do you think? Do you think that from what we've just heard, the US real estate market might start to become a bit more normal? Yes, this is sort of one of the many mind boggling stats about this whole system, to be honest. It truly is a sort of vast number of people working in this industry. And I agree it does seem a little too many. For all those reasons, the number of people involved in the industry, the amount of money that is at stake. And the fact that the real estate industry is just so integral to people's lives, I mean, you've had economic advisors to Joe Biden saying that they think that the presence of this really high realistic commission is one of the reasons that labor mobility in the US is lower than you might expect, essentially, because it's just such a huge fee to pay to move house that it sort of suppresses the ability of people to sort of move for work. This story is so important and there are so much at stake that I really cannot overexpress how interested I am to see whether these rule changes, which are quite in the weeds of how the industry works and sometimes seem sort of little niche or complicated, to see whether they are effective in changing how the system works. And I have been, as a result, lurking in real to forums and subreddits and groups over the last couple of months to see what the initial impact to these sort of two major rule changes that we've mentioned are. And there's one sign that I think is quite encouraging, which is what Rob described about cellar behaviour, which does seem to be happening. So you're seeing sort of a lot of anecdotal evidence now that instead of offering a sort of blanket 2.5% or 3% commission for any buyer's agent that brings a buyer to the home, sellers are instead saying, why don't you just include what you want me to pay in buyer's agent commission in the offer and we can negotiate and see where we end up. And now, obviously, as a buyer, if you've agreed to pay your buyer's agent 3% or 2.5%, and somebody else has agreed to pay theirs just 1%, saying the hypothetical world in which you can both offer a million dollars at max on a home, if you've agreed to pay the higher commission, you'll probably lose. And so if that becomes the norm, if sellers saying, well, just tell me what you need in the offer becomes the norm, it does seem like eventually that will trickle through to buyers negotiating more aggressively with their agents before they hire them. And that seems to me like a real shift in the system that will lead to sort of commissions coming down. So that does make me a little hopeful. I think it's going to take a bit longer, as Rob said, to see that change trickle down to these buyer's agent agreements. But the other point that I guess I would make is that one of the big differences between the European system and the American system when I sort of first came here is the existence of buyers agents at all. These aren't people that are involved in transactions in the UK and in a lot of Europe, for the most part buyers sort of represent themselves. And initially I was sort of surprised by their existence and wonder Yes, so I obviously did buy a house in the US last year, and I must say before that process, I was also a bit skeptical of the sort of need for buyers agents because they don't really exist in the UK. I've never heard of anyone using them and for the most part, everyone seems to get along just fine. But I did actually end up having a very good experience with my buyer's agent, essentially being forced to use one, convinced me that they do have their uses, both in pointing out pitfalls and houses that I might not have noticed. And in particular in the real estate market in America over the last few years, in helping to craft an offer that could win in what was just an insanely competitive market. Like I really don't think that we would have won the house if we hadn't had the advice of our buyer's agent. So it is a service I'd be willing to pay for. The big question is how much and the answer is probably nothing near what I did actually end up paying or the sellers of the house ended up paying. But with that, that's probably more than enough said about the topic of this week's show and it's probably time for us to pivot to our stats of the week. And seeing as there's no competition this week, I hand the floor to you, Mike. Yeah, I agree there are some sort of interesting financial ramifications of this. One is that the areas in which the storm did damage are quite different than the areas you might have expected that a hurricane would affect. And I do wonder, you know, we've done episodes about catastrophe insurance and climate change related insurance in the past. And up until now, it's sort of been a problem that you could sort of, oh, well, that affects Florida. After this week, the extent of the damage and the location of it, we really changed how people feel about that kind of idea. My stat of the week this week, it is related to sort of antitrust and competition in general, which is that next week the government is due to present the sort of range of solutions that it might seek out in one of the big Google antitrust cases in which a judge found in August that Google was a novelist of general search engines. And in that lawsuit, one of our interesting stat came out, which is the amount of money that Google pays, other browsers and handset makers to be the default search engine when you power up Safari or Firefox or anything else. And that is $26 billion a year for that privilege, which struck me as quite a lot of money. We've had quite a lot also still quite a lot of money. Well, this is money talks, so quite a lot of money is I guess what we should talk about quite a lot of the time. But with that, all that's left for me to do is to thank Michael Ketchmark and Rob Haran. And thank you for listening to Money Talks. You can always I'm Alice Foward. I'm Mike Bird. And this is the economist."

Florida marks what was once the city's northern boundary and Ohio hugs East Potomac Park. But of all the streets in Washington, D.C. named after the nation's 50 states, the most famous, wide-grand boulevard that links the capital building and the White House is called Pennsylvania Avenue. No one knows for sure why it was the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which was awarded the Crem de la Creme of D.C. Streets. The most likely explanation is that the nation's capital having been moved from Philadelphia to D.C. it was intended as a consolation prize. Pennsylvania Avenue is the road of the White House. And for Donald Trump and Carmela Harris, the road to the White House is likely to live our Pennsylvania's 19 electoral college votes. With 32 days to go until the 2024 election, I'm John Prado and this is Chex and Balance from the Economist. Each week we take one big theme shaping American politics and explore it in depth. Today, who's winning in Pennsylvania? Whoever captures Pennsylvania will probably be elected president, according to the Economist's forecast model, it's the most likely tipping point state. We've travelled to three different parts of the Commonwealth to assess how the campaign is going and to try to read the electoral T-Leaves. What will it take to win in Pennsylvania in November? With me this week to discuss what's going on in the Keystone state in the last few weeks of this election are Charlotte Howard and Idris Calune. We've all been to Pennsylvania recently but we didn't manage to go together which seems like a bit of a shame but that does mean we covered a lot of ground. Charlotte, how are you doing? What's going on? I can see you're back in New York. What's up there? It's an amazing story. It does feel a bit like DC in the 80s. Idris, how are you doing? podcast is not sponsored by the Pennsylvania tourist board but it might as well be because the part of the state that I went to Pennsylvania 8 is very, very pretty. Particularly at this time of year, beautiful, full color and just all around a very nice place to be. Eric is very beautiful. This is true. Before we get into it though, this is the last episode of checks and balance that we're making free to listen to. If you want to carry on listening to us until the election and beyond then you'll need to be a subscriber. If you are already, thank you. That makes all the journalism we do here possible. If you're not, we really hope you'll consider joining us. Search economist podcasts for a free trial. Okay, Charlotte, we're going to start off with you. You went to Eastern Pennsylvania. Tell us about the trip you took to the state's third biggest city. the campaigns on the ground. Charlotte, there are six swing states that will determine the 2024 election, or seven if you include North Carolina. Why have we decided to go big on Pennsylvania? time there as they are. And the reason Pennsylvania is a swing state, of course, is not that it's perfectly representative of the country as a whole. It's because it's a few clicks to the right of America. And you see that reflected in the demography. It's a bit older than the country as a whole. So 20% of the population of Pennsylvania is 65 years or older versus 17.7% or 18% of America as a whole. And it's a smidgen poorer than the country as a whole. So the median household income in Pennsylvania is about $74,000 versus $78,000 in the rest of the country. It's a bit wider than America as a whole. And all these things help to put Pennsylvania a couple of percentage points to the right politically, to the right of the nation politically. And that's why it's such a bell with that. I mean, were the electoral college perfectly representative of the country as a whole, than the fact that Harris is clearly ahead in the popular vote would lead our model to make her a heavier favorite than she is. As it is, it's pretty much 50, 50 in our model. Charlotte, what are the key issues in Pennsylvania? And do they differ from those in the country as a whole? Okay, next we'll go to a more rural part of the Commonwealth. And I'll tell you guys about my trip to Trump country. But before we do that, Charlottes and Idris, what have you particularly enjoyed from the economist's recent coverage? Perhaps enjoy doesn't the right word given how much turbulence there is in the world at the moment, but in any case, what would you recommend to our Next up, I took a trip to the far northeast of Pennsylvania. The eighth congressional district borders the states of New York and New Jersey. And I went there to find out how the Republican party is approaching this election. I'm at the cross street of Adams and Biden street in downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania, having driven on the President Joe Biden highway to get here. This is an area that is closely associated with the sitting president, but it's in Pennsylvania's eighth congressional district. Pennsylvania eighth is a classic Obama to Trump district. So in 2012, Barack Obama with Joe Biden as Vice President won this district by 12 points, more or less. And then in 2016, there was a huge swing towards Donald Trump. He won it by 9.6. In 2020, Donald Trump won again, but the margin was much closer to 0.9 points. So if Kamala Harris and Tim Wolts are to win Pennsylvania, they need to get closer to Joe Biden's result in 2020 than to Hillary Clinton's result in 2016. This is an area that used to be an industrial area. It is whiter than America on average. It is slightly less educated. And there's a bit of a sense that it's an area that's been in decline economically. And so for all of those reasons, it is Trump. Donald Trump is going to win here. On November 5, the question is how big will the margin be? Pennsylvania eighth is unusual because despite having been won by Donald Trump, it's still represented by a Democrat in the House of Representatives. So Republicans are aggressively targeting this seat. At a campaign event, Lu Barletta, a former congressman with teeth so white they have their own parody account on X warmed up the crowd. When he was in office, he had made immigration his signature issue. And now he had a sense of vindication. Immigration is still relatively low in this bit of Pennsylvania. The population is up ever so slightly since the pandemic, but that came after decades of decline. But still talking about immigration works. One other attack line cut through to the crowd. The Republican now running for the seat is a 34 year old political newcomer, Rob Bresnerhan. He's a local son who inherited his family's construction business. In all his messaging, he emphasizes his political moderation. Because I'm not the Pennsylvania way, In his ads and pamphlets, Bresnerhan is keen to mention those are union jobs he created. What Bresnerhan didn't mention, even in this room of Republican faithful, who chose to come to an event on a drizzly Wednesday night, was Donald Trump. There were a few digs at Kamala Harris, but otherwise, the presidential race was absent. That's not to say Trump doesn't have a base of support here. I also spoke with TJ Fitzgerald, who runs a grassroots Republican organization in Luzern, one of the counties that PA8 includes. He says he's not sure he ever even voted before 2016. to change like Lincoln. Fitzgerald is obviously passionate. You can hear him hitting the table as he talks. His organization is doing the kind of small ball work, organizing door knocking and registering voters that can add up in close races. But his story also says something about how, despite all the polarization in America, everyone has individual reasons for holding the political involved. He's also organizing poll watches because he's concerned about the integrity of the vote. He's testified to Congress about Republican claims that there were issues with the vote in Pennsylvania in 2020. For him, the stakes seem existential. And right now, if we don't win, to keep freedom, we need to win. Lots of Trump supporters are genuinely scared about what happens if their man loses. And if he does lose, for TJ Fitzgerald, it will be because those elites found a way to pass over and to hurt the common person once again. Idris talking to TJ Fitzgerald for me was a reminder that there are things that are axiomatically true on the right, like that Hillary Clinton wants to put Trump supporters in camps or that people in Springfield are eating pets. That people on the left or who pay attention to mainstream media in America are just completely unaware of. So do you know what that's a reference to? distance between what the guy running for Congress and a competitive district is saying in his messaging. And when you go and talk to Trump activists, how they view things. So Rob Brothers and a hand is running in a competitive district. His messaging is much more moderate. He presents himself as a moderate. You heard there in that little clip at the event we went to he was saying, I'm all four electric cars. People can drive them if they want to. That's great. But what I don't want is the government telling me that I must drive one. That's quite a clever position because it both keeps Republicans in the base happy. But it also says, hey, I get that climate changes are thing and maybe electric cars are good. Most obviously he didn't mention Trump at all, which is pretty striking. But then if you go and talk to local Republican activists and as you say, they're not always a completely representative tribe, though TJ Fitzgerald is worth double underlining did testify to Congress about, you know, Republican allegations of election fraud in Pennsylvania back in 2020. But among them, the level of threat they feel from Democrats is just incredibly high and they love Donald Trump. And then I guess the last thing I tell you on that is whenever you talk to voters or political activists, the reasons why they hold their views are pretty complicated and don't fit in necessarily to the neat stories we tell ourselves about polarization. So there's one guy I talked to as a Trump activist who was really cross because I'm just going to try and get this right. A bit of forest near where he lives has been cleared in order to put solar panels up, he said. So that's bad enough. It's the federal government deforesting his neighborhood in order to put solar panels up. But more than that, these solar panels had displaced some local bears. So he was now worried that he and his neighbors were going to get eaten by the bears. So, you know, not only is Kamala Harris a threat to democracy, but her environmental policy is a direct threat to the to the lives of him and his neighbors. Sorry. I guess the phenomenon that you thing I was keen to understand when I was there how Republican voters, how Republican activists think about the fairness of the election system in Pennsylvania. My impression was the views of the people I was talking to were a bit shaped by the fact that they were talking to an outsider with a funny accent. And when I asked about whether the result in 2020 would be trustworthy, whether they'd accept it if Kamala Harris won, most didn't want to say outright, no, we wouldn't. That 2020 was stolen. They didn't sound full on, stop the steel in a Rudy Giuliani manner. What they do do is just raise questions and doubts. And I think the truth is the system for electing presidents in America and in Pennsylvania, it's pretty complicated. Each county has different rules. The way American states run their registers of voters is a bit complicated compared with other countries. So it does seem like as Idris wrote in his excellent cover story, this is a question of a complicated system that's hard to understand, meeting a group of people who are primed to not trust it. And that's a pretty bad recipe. Well, I think if Trump wins, all of these doubts will conspiracy kind of breeding ground. Yeah, I think that's right. I did talk to an election administrator in one of the counties in PA8. And she seemed very confident that the election would go smoothly. She thought that they were well prepared that the count would happen promptly. She was spending a lot of time trying to communicate this to a Republican voters in particular, and I think having a difficult time with that. All right, we'll be back in a moment here about Idris's tour of beautiful Western Pennsylvania. Idris, to finish up our trifecta of Pennsylvania road trips, you've been to its western edges. So it reads just to underline how different eerie is to the bits of Pennsylvania than Charlotte and I were with. It's really, really swing territory. I mean, as you said, only two counties went from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in 2022 out of Pennsylvania 67 counties and eerie is one of You'd like both of you. I'm very struck by the retro nature of the economic messaging in this campaign. And I think it's partly explained by the fact that three of the key states are part of the rust belt, the fact that Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are so key, I think explains a lot of the rhetoric. Idris, something we haven't talked about yet on the podcast is African American voters in Pennsylvania. There are lots, particularly in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and they're going to be important as well. So what, if anything, did you glean from your trip about that demographic? some weakness there too. Well, I expect some of us will be in Pennsylvania for election week itself. So hopefully it won't take too long for the state to count its votes and then we'll know what's actually happened. Okay, it's quiz time. This one is about the Electoral College. Pennsylvania has 19 Electoral College votes as we discussed earlier. And there's one other state that has the same and say that by making dad jokes, you're doing cultural appropriation and I apologize to our trips. Love that. That is really good. I enjoyed that very much. And I just want to tell you good. Yeah, at least do you want to guess what the answer to the question is also we just ignore the question entirely and go to question two. I'm going to guess, Illinois. Is the right answer, Charlotte, your deflection was masterful, but ultimately failed. I actually gave me a lot of time electoral college votes. How many of them can you name? Oh, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Here's the right answer. I think you've got so many points for that. Um, Charlotte, you're running a little behind, but we'll go for question three. Anyway, can you name the top four states with the New York, Florida. That's so close. California, Texas, Florida, New York, New York, New York, this week. Thank you, Charlotte. Thank you, Adres. Thank you. Thank you.

In petty codes, the luminous skirts and tight corsets, the voters stepped into the polling station. It wasn't an unusual site. Early 19th century New Jersey was notably progressive when it came to the franchise and allowed some women, as well as free African-American men, to vote. But look closer at the women voters, and something was up. Above the MPa waistlines and below the bonnets were suspiciously male faces. Or at least, this is what the local Republican Party claimed. Women were more likely to vote federalist, and so the opposition said that many female voters were, in fact, men who'd voted once, then changed into drag to vote again. Republicans used the accusations of voter fraud to disenfranchise the women of New Jersey. It's a move that would fit into the MAGA playbook. Donald Trump falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen, and he's likely to do it again if he loses this November. With 46 days to go until the 2024 election, I'm John Prado and this is Chex and Balance from the Economist. Each week we take one big theme shaping American politics and explore it in depth. Today, what will happen if the election is contested? Republicans are already preparing to challenge the result if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, because the gap between voting and certification is so drawn out, and the person who wins the most votes doesn't necessarily win power, American elections, demand patience and trust. But with Donald Trump on the ballot, that's unlikely. How ugly could this election get? With me this week to talk about how America's presidential election will likely go this time, and this is really talking about the process rather than the result, who's going to win, are Charlotte Howard in New York and Idris Calune back in Washington. Idris, you've been off reporting for this story, which is a cover story in the Economist, and so I think this is going to be one of these episodes where Charlotte and I gently grill you. We're also going to hear from Congressman Jamie Raskin and Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia. Idris, how are you doing? And Charlotte, how are you? What's news from New York? Yeah, those events will be really good. This week's episode is about how America elects its presidents the process. And also what happens when that complicated, drawn-out process collides with a political movement that is determined to say that there's widespread fraud if it's candidate loses. We're going to start by hearing from Jeff Duncan, who was Georgia's Republican lieutenant governor when Donald Trump and his allies tried to overturn the 2020 results in that state. Duncan resisted those efforts, and he's now campaigning for Kamala Harris. He took me back to what happened in Georgia in 2020. other Republicans when you started doing that? Not much or a lot. How did that go? Because I'm really interested. Earlier you said it was clear by 2020 that he wasn't a good candidate and wasn't a good president. But I reported on that election and talking to lots of centrist Republicans, a lot of folks took almost a kind of vow of silence. Let's just keep our heads down and hope that this blows over. What kind of pushback did you get when you started making those calls? Or did you find that most Republicans in Georgia off the record were in Can we talk about November this year? There's a scenario in which Donald Trump wins and then Kamala Harris concedes. There's a scenario where Kamala Harris wins and I think everybody agrees that Donald Trump doesn't concede. How likely are we to see a repeat of what happened in 2020 this time around? To what extent do you think the problems that showed up in the system in 2020 have been fixed since then? Or are you anxious that we might see a repeat? A lot to unpack there, And Mr Duncan, you spoke at the DNC, gave a very powerful speech there. You've come out publicly, not just against Donald Trump at some considerable risk to yourself, unfortunately, but in favor of Kamala Harris and not all of Mr Trump's political opponents have formed a Republican to oppose him, have made that calculus. Why did you? Why go the step further and not just to pose the former president, but endorse and campaign for his challenger? I think it comes down to if either do I It reads back in 2020, you did a bunch of reporting from swing states, Arizona, in particular, but also some other states on the electoral process and the counting. And you've gone and repeated that this year to see what's changed. So let's start with a recap. How were things in 2020? What were the vulnerabilities in the system that allowed the challenges by Donald Trump and his team to get lots of our listeners probably live in countries where election rules for national elections are the same in every part of that country. This is not the case in America. There's huge variation reads to be clear, but it is a complex and rather bloody system for choosing the world's most powerful person.

Charlotte and Idris, what have you particularly enjoyed from our recent coverage that people who take out a subscription or a trial will be able to read or listen to? I really enjoyed I caught up of the United States. It was a real nail-biter. As the night drew on, it seemed like John F Kennedy was on course to win the 1960 presidential election, but it was tight. When at 4am Richard Nixon spoke to a bacterium of his supporters on live television, he wasn't quite ready to admit defeat. It would take until noon the next day for the results to be official. electoral vote. Kennedy's margin in the electoral college was comfortable with 303 votes to Nixon's 219. But the popular vote was the closest of the 20th century. There were less than 120,000 ballots in it and tight margins in many states. Nixon publicly accepted the result, but some of his allies, including R&C Chair and Kentucky Senator Thrusten B. Morton, were suspicious. Morton and other top Nixon aides formed a committee to investigate the results in 11 states, focusing on two in particular. Kennedy had won Illinois by just 9,000 votes, and Republicans suspected the powerful machine of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had fraudulently tipped the result in the Democrats' favor. They were also skeptical of the outcome in Texas, which Kennedy had won by 46,000 votes out of the 2.3 million cast. It was home to Kennedy's Vice President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, who had influential allies in the state. If Illinois and Texas had gone red, it would have handed the presidency to Nixon. Morton was asked if Nixon and Nixon distanced himself in public, not wanting to appear a sore loser, but some think that was just for show. There are reports that at a party that Christmas he told guests, we won, but they stole it from us, and that he was encouraging his aides behind the scenes. In his memoirs, he wrote that there was no doubt there was substantial fraud in the 1960 election. But despite their best efforts, Nixon's allies weren't able to prove this. Their attempts to challenge the election results made no tangible difference. Historians now think that there probably was some fraud in Illinois and Texas, but not enough to change the result. The campaign did succeed in creating uncertainty about the election, with articles in sympathetic newspapers and even the New York Times a month after polling day, writing that the Illinois results remain in doubt. John F Kennedy, the state of Massachusetts, vice president, Richard Nixon had the unpleasant task of certifying the results of an election he had Whatever Nixon's involvement behind the scenes, it was important that he publicly accepted his defeat. If Donald Trump loses in November, he won't be so gracious. Charlotte, it's not great when people are comparing your behavior to Richard Nixon's and holding up Nixon as an example of what to do instead, but that story is a reminder of how important some of the norms are in America's constitution. The idea that a candidate who loses conceits because this process is so complicated and as Adry said at the beginning, it runs on trust. The behavior It's as part of your reporting, I know you spoke to some Republicans who are all in on the stop the steel movement. What did you hear from then about critiques of the electoral process in Idris, one thing that is different in 2024 compared with 2020 is that Congress reformed the electoral contact that was passed in 2022, so nearly two years ago. And it has an effect on how election certification, which was actually what was going on on January the 6th, how that would go. But the original electoral contact itself arose from a contested election at the end of the 19th Okay, so there are some pretty important differences when it comes to electoral process in 2024 compared with last time around. We'll be back in a moment, consider what might happen if Kamala Harris wins and Donald Trump loses. But Mr. Trump challenges the election result in November. slip away so easily. It's, I want to get into some of Congressman Raskin's concerns about what the Republicans might do. But can we start with the Democrats? The way he talked about the election sounded like it was impossible that Donald Trump could win fairly. But that's not the case. Our presidential model says this race is incredibly close, not that far away from 50-50. So imagine a scenario in which Donald Trump did win. Would Democrats accept the result? outcome of the election. I agree with you, Charlotte, but I think there's a realistic scenario here where Donald Trump wins very narrowly. This election is going to be unbelievably close. There are some court cases brought about state election results. Those cases end up being decided by the Supreme Court where three of the Conservative members worked on George W. Bush's defence team in Bush v. Gore in 2000 and Democrats accepting a result handed down by the Supreme Court that favors Donald Trump when he put three justices there. I agree with you that you wouldn't have to worry about violence in that situation, but I could imagine quite a large number of Democrats voting not to certify the election result in Congress. But Adrice, let's stick with this scenario where Harris wins and Trump refuses to concede. How do you think it would go this time around? basic job of running the country. Right. So I think it's important to be clear here what we're saying and what we're not saying. America's presidential election may not go completely smoothly, but there will be a winner and there'll be a peaceful transfer of power eventually in January. But even if the stop the steel stuff fails as a legal movement, as happened in 2020, it can still succeed in some ways as a political movement. And among other things, that makes it extremely hard for the Republican party to move beyond Donald Trump because very large numbers of Republicans, so Dries said earlier, 70% at the moment don't accept that he lost. And if you think your candidate didn't lose, why would you move beyond them? Well, I expect this won't be the last conversation we have about election administration in the 45 days before the vote. But let's leave it there for now. I have a quiz for you. Question one earlier, we heard about the 1960 election. The winner, John F. Kennedy was the first president born in the 20th century. Who was the second? LBJ is the right answer. He seemed much older than Kennedy, but there was only a fact It was right, even though you're a bit sensitive. Question two, JFK was born in 1917. When was Nixon born? A few years either side gets to your point. It was 1913, so 1911 is a smidge and closer. Question three, both JFK and Nixon were elected to Congress for the first time in the same year. 1954. It was 1946. Oh, a dress. Nixon actually beat Kennedy to the Senate. Nixon was elected as Senator in 1950, JFK in 1952. I think that's two on to Charlotte. I also lost it. Very sure. Don't want to be a sore loser. You'll have your chance to get your revenge next week.

In the meantime, thanks very much for listening. We'll have more checks and balance next week. The Economist Carmen Curoga spent months at the end of 2022 preparing to open a breakfast cafe in Coventry, a small town in East Central Connecticut. She painstakingly renovated a building and carefully considered the name, something that would make people think of breakfast, preferably with an O in it so she could use a fried egg in the logo. She reckons she'd struck gold with a word she thought just meant to wake up in the morning and proudly opened her new business, woke breakfast and coffee. That's when the uproar began. Local conservatives were outraged, thinking that Curoga was making a political statement and threatened to boycott the cafe. Curoga had migrated from Mexico a number of years earlier and had no idea she'd named her cafe after one of the most triggering words in American politics. Luckily, Foccaroga, most people were supportive and locals can still head to Main Street for their woke, coffee and eggs. With 39 days to go until the 2024 election, I'm John Prado and this is Chex and Balance from the Economist. Each week we take one big theme shaping American politics and explore it in depth. Today, why is America becoming less woke? Over the past decade, a form of wokeness arose, particularly on the Liberal Left, which was characterized by extreme pessimism about America and its capacity to make progress, especially regarding race. Analysis by the Economist looking at how influential these ideas are today finds that wokeness peaked in 2021-22 and has since receded. What will come after peak woke? And what does this all mean for American politics? Give me this week to discuss the passing of peak woke and what comes next are Idris Kalun in Washington, DC and Charlotte Howard also in Washington this week. Charlotte, what takes you to DC? Good, I'm looking forward to that too. I am. I'm in Pennsylvania's eighth congressional district and we're going to be talking about Pennsylvania on the podcast next week and I've been having a really interesting time going in round talking to voters and candidates and one of the things that struck me being here, I was at a political event for a candidate, Republican candidate who's running for Congress last night and there were two policy issues he majored on. One was the border and illegal immigration which you'd expect, I think, in a district like this. And the other was woken us in the Democratic Party and the sense that the Democratic Party has gone way to the left and Republicans are the only party that have sensible American values. So anti-wokenness in America still has huge political salience even though as we wrote in last week's economist, peak woke in America has passed. Our episode this week is based on some work done by a couple of our colleagues, Ainsley Johnston and Sasha Nauter. We'll hear from Sasha later. But first, I wanted to speak with Ainsley who's a data journalist at the economist. I wondered how you measure something as nebulous as wokenness. And so she took me through that and how she and Sasha were able to determine that woke has indeed peaked. OK, so that's the public opinion part, looking at lots and lots of survey data. You also looked at American media and how people in the media, writers, editors, cover these topics. So how did you go about doing that? And what did you find? So Ainsley, you looked at survey data for public opinion, you looked at the media, and you've also looked at academic institutions and businesses. So what's the picture there? And Ainsley, we've talked about the overall top-line numbers. Are there any findings? Are there any patterns within those top lines that surprised you? And you found them? Charlotte, before I ask you about Ainsley's findings, you said at the beginning that you have a different definition to the one I offered earlier. So do you want to try and define this nebulous word before we go any further? Yeah, I'd agree with you on that. I think it treats you on a venture your own definition of what this slippery word means or has come to mean. I think you're absolutely right on the chronology of this, Charlotte. And it coincides roughly with the time I moved to America. And I became fascinated. Like lots of people who moved to America, I became fascinated by a civil war history and the sort of deep patterns in American history. And so I think what the work-ness movement gets right is that history matters. And there are hangovers from American history that are still present in American society today. But I think what you also saw happen over the course of about decade is it almost seemed like white liberals discovered that racism was prevalent and it was bad. But they made that discovery at a time when America was becoming a lot less racist on many metrics. If you look at some of the most recent sociology on race in America, Raj Chetty put out a paper in July, which we wrote about in the economist, and that tracked 57 million people born in America between 1978 and 1992. And it showed that for that cohort, race becomes less important as a determining factor of life outcomes and class income becomes more important. And so I don't disagree with you that it's important to pay attention to racial injustice and that those murders by police officers of young black men were appalling. But I think there was a disconnect between what was actually going on in the country and their view, the sort of widespread view that you saw sort of propagated that America was sort of irredeemably racist and no progress was being made. So I suppose that's maybe just a difference of interpretation. Yeah, I agree with that. So this set of ideas has ebbed on the left and even in the middle of the democratic party, but the counter-reaction, the anti-woke movement, is as strong as it's ever been. It's like the two phenomena are pretty divorced from each other. That's a familiar pattern in American history. The way progress is made sometimes is that you have these awakenings and then excesses and counter-revolution and then progress gets made in a bumpy way. And there is a case that that's what's happened here. We'll go back and look at some more peak-work moments in American history in a moment. But first, this and the next episode of checks and balance are free for everyone to listen to, but to join us until the election and beyond, you'll need to be a subscriber. If you want to do that, search economist podcasts for a free trial. Charlotte Inidries, what would you guys recommend to our listeners to make the most of their subscriptions? Yeah, that's one of the great things about the economist Isirido or Alistina, sometimes the other stories that other organisations don't pay attention to, we find space for. I'm just going to add my own recommendation. This week's Drum Tower episode is a long interview with Michael Koverig. He was a Canadian diplomat who was held hostage, frankly, by the Chinese government, disappeared by the secret police. And he talks, I think, for the first time, about his thousand plus days in captivity and it's spellbinding and very informative about China. So go listen to that if you have a subscription. Moosa Algarbi is an assistant professor at Stony Brook University. He has a new book which is called We Have Never Been Woke, coming out soon. And it considers why even as changes to the global economy have favoured knowledge industries, the social problems they're concerned with haven't got better. As part of that, he's identified three periods of peak work, all great awokenings, as he calls them, that preceded the one that we've just lived through. We asked him to take us through each one. Andrew, what do you make of that and particularly the idea that walkness flowers in American things we've seen in the past couple of years is that an illiberal movement has prompted a deeply illiberal response it's just you want to say anything about the anti-work movement be about yeah there's a pretty pessimistic interpretation of what's happened in workness and anti-workness over the past decade or so which is that the work movement strikingly short on policy achievements and it reads talked about the collapse of Black Lives Matter and the inability of people in that movement to put forward reform suggestions that were workable and popular and on the other hand the counter-reaction which has resulted in a lot of bills being passed in state houses and some very real changes I'm a bit more optimistic than that about how this process has played out over the long term and we'll be back in a moment to assess some of the political implications of the end of peak work at least for now in America Sasha Nauta is the economist's social affairs editor based in our DC office with Idris and she's one of the brains behind our coverage of peak work when we spoke earlier in the week I asked her why this was the topic she was keen to delve into well it's such a motive subject I mean should we talk about some of the excesses that get the attention let's start with that excesses that we saw more of during peak work and what has this phenomenon left behind as it receipts if you think about it as a tide going out how's it changed the country I think we'll know Charlotte can we turn to the politics for this because you can make an argument that looking at systemic racism say is useful in sociology in academia but in politics it's a disaster really on the left it sounds like you're saying to people you're a racist and there's nothing you can do about it and so whatever about systemic racism as an academic concept or I think there's some validity as a political project is an absolute disaster for the democratic party and I think that's reflected in the very different sorts of emphasis you see in Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign versus her primary campaign in 2020 yes I think Harris clearly has moved sharp turn in democratic party rhetoric on these sorts of subjects I was looking back at 2019 at Beto-Arrux campaign and he's a politician I admire in many ways you know I sat down and it fused him and he's impressive but I think he'd agree with us on lots of things he's pretty mainstream but in 2019 he described American capitalism as racist Kamala Harris has just given a speech in which he said I'm a capitalist but there's there's just been such a big change in the democratic parties where I've talking about these issues it does seem like they've learned a lesson that embracing a bunch of ideas that seem very progressive at the time turned out not to have delivered a lot of progress but being quite unpopular was a bad strategy and it seems like the self-correction the faster they can do that the better yes Charlotte I hardly agree with that and for all our work on the decline of workness in America recently I think the one thing that could bring it back is the re-election of Donald Trump so there's you know a perverse thing going on here right where anti-workness is a very powerful force in the Republican party but the most powerful force for the revival of the ideas we've been talking about would be the re-election of Donald Trump on November 5th okay before we go it's quid's time question one Miriam Webster's dictionary used to just define work as the past tense and past participle of wake in what year did it add the updated definition defines work as aware of and actively attentive to important societal facts and issues especially issues of racial and social justice I think by that definition all three of us are pretty work question two run to Santis past florida's stop woke act in 2022 what does the woke in the part of it stop stop wrecking our kids act it's close it stops wrongs to our kids and employees act so super catchy question three over the past decade many companies have tried to prove their social justice credentials through woke marketing campaigns during pride month in 2019 marks and Spencer which is a British supermarket clothing brand launched an LGBT plus sandwich what was in it that's not a good pretty close yeah actually the sandwich sounds decent it was lettuce guacamole bacon and tomato so a play on the classic BLT the sandwich was sold to raise money for LGBT plus charities but was criticized by some people as being tokenistic but that's it for this week thank you Charlotte thank you Adres thank you thank you this episode was produced by Harriet Noble and

We haven't discussed Eric Adams on the pod yet as a New York resident I'm waiting to see when or whether our mayor will decide that he should no longer be the mayor given the range of charges brought against him by the federal government. Yes, I went to Allentown which is an hour or so north of Philadelphia about two hours west of New York. It is in that blue belt of Democratic counties in the east of Pennsylvania. It's distinct from the Philadelphia suburbs though. It has an industrial past. It's right next to Northampton County which is a key swing county in this election. I went to Allentown to speak to Christopher Borrick who is a professor of political science at Mule and Berg College and he set out Pennsylvania's political geography for me. So it was always clear that Pennsylvania was going to be a battleground and then Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Harris entered the race. How did that switch affect the battle One of the political tactics that's been deployed right is to have a strategy of trying to compete in certain counties where a given party knows that they'll lose but they want to lose by a smaller margin. What do you make of that this time around in Pennsylvania and where might that be most knows is tight. What are the big things that you're watching for now with just a few weeks to go amazingly until election day? What are the things you have your eye on? I'm interested in classic Is that because the Trump campaign is just doubling down on certain areas of the state where they know they already have an advantage in it to turn out bet? I'm not positive. There's certainly Well, it's a swing state where the campaigns are really running neck and neck, and it's a swing state that has the most electoral votes, 19 to Georgia and North Carolina's 16, which are the next biggest states. Trump, if he can flip Pennsylvania, which voted for Biden last time, if he can flip Pennsylvania and one other big state like Georgia, he could win. Either candidate could win the presidency without winning Pennsylvania, but it's really hard to do that. So it's no surprise that it's attracting a huge amount of cash and lots of visits from late September through election day. Groups supporting the campaigns ever served more than $138 million in airtime in Pennsylvania. That's more than 50% more cash than in the next closest state for big campaign spending, which is Michigan. So it's attracting a huge amount of attention. And so when you see where campaigns are spending their time or the areas of interest, if you think about the entire state running east to west, you have Philadelphia, which is historically, of course, a democratic stronghold. The suburbs around Philadelphia, which have leaned much more blue, then you have the Lehigh Valley where I was where you have Allentown, which is an increasingly Hispanic city, but the Lehigh Valley has an old industrial past. You have Northampton, county, just north of Allentown, which was home to Bethlehem Steel, is a real swing county. And then you have lots of rural areas. You go further west, you get to Pittsburgh, which is the second biggest city in Pennsylvania, a democratic stronghold, but with Republican leaning suburbs. And then up to Erie in the northwest where you were, Adriees, right? Yes and no, in that the economy is very much the top issue in Pennsylvania. And immigration, which is another big issue nationally, is slightly less important in Pennsylvania. But it really is the economy where each campaign needs to try to win over voters. And North Ampton, which I mentioned earlier, and which we've covered in the economists itself, it's really a bell-weather county near Allentown. It's in the Lehigh Valley. It went for Obama twice, then for Trump, then back to Biden. And I thought it was kind of an interesting window into the challenge for Democrats on messaging here. So North Ampton has a history as a manufacturing center. Bethlehem is in the bottom of this pretty valley. I don't know if you either have you drove past it on your trips, but you look down into Bethlehem and you see the old smoke stacks of Bethlehem steel rising up. It feels like the visual equivalent of a church spire and an English village. And manufacturing continues to be treated with this kind of religious reverence. And if you look at the state more broadly, the idea that you would let US steel, which is headquartered in Pittsburgh, where Adrice was basal to Nippon, a Japanese company, continues to be treated with a kind of blasphemy. Biden opposes that sale of US steel to Nippon. But in Bethlehem itself, it's not the case anymore that it's some kind of desolate place that never recovered from post-industrial woes. Pittsburgh similarly has huge economy based on its educational and health care institutions. And in North Ampton, the region has had other growth, not to the same extent as Pittsburgh, but certainly in health care and education also in logistics. So it's not like it's an overly depressed place, but it still is a place that is in transition, right? And like many other regions, it's keen to see additional investment. It's voters want to see inflation subside. It has been the beneficiary of some Biden policies to help for clean energy infrastructure. But it's kind of hard to make that messaging land, A, when those projects haven't been built yet, and B, when inflation continues to be the real economic force that voters feel on a daily basis. So the Biden policies feel more theoretical and the inflation that you see at the grocery store, at the pump feels very real. And I was talking to one Democratic official who was talking a little bit about the challenge of putting the economic message into sound bites for the Democrats. And it's just hard to do really well. You hear Democrats talking about greed deflation as the reason why inflation is high, trying to blame companies for this. I don't know that that really lands. I think Trump has an easier job in just saying it's Biden's fault. readers and listeners? The cover of the economist this week is on the year that shattered the Middle East and includes all kinds of coverage from our colleagues covering both the current escalating conflict and explaining how the region more broadly has changed over the past year. It's excellent. campaigning in Pennsylvania. One thing that I think I struggle with a bit is that every coalition, every political party has people within it who say things that sound strange and not entirely connected to reality. And so trying to decipher what is the fringe person talking about a given issue and how closely that person's views are aligned with the policies of whoever it is they support. So whether it's Trump himself or JD Vance or someone running for Congress, I think that that's an important exercise to do in exploring the political landscape of a given place. So John, how do you think about that in this context? Well, the thing that really struck me on that is the just explained in my mind points to, I think, some of the strangeness of this election, right? Because I think someone who's going to blame Kamala Harris for bears marauding through the streets. I mean, that person is going to blame Kamala Harris for anything, I think, right? And for political candidates, probably on both sides of this race, right? The challenge is not alienating the real die-hards and encouraging them to turn out and not alienating the swing voters of which there are some who will make a difference in Pennsylvania. I am struck by how the broader issues of election integrity, which Adrice covered so well in a recent cover story, are playing out in Pennsylvania. These are very active issues in the courts, too. They are. And that was another around the state. I think a challenge for any campaign is how to marry immediate concerns. In this case, I think inflation within a broader narrative that is tied. I think you're right, Adrie's two questions of perception of whether the past and prior period of someone's life looks rozier than what they expect the future to be. I was struck by in both campaigns, though, how much of the economic messaging does feel pretty retro, right? I mean, we're talking about a sense of restoring a certain type of economy in both parties. We're talking about promoting union jobs in the case of the Democrats, Trump talks about trying to restore a kind of economic prosperity that has been lost in the Biden years. So in both cases, there is a bit of a retro economic messaging that is happening within a quite new economic framework of protectionism transition is probably most striking in places like Loco on the county, which contains Scranton, where Joe Biden was born and Biden helped to win back that white Catholic vote that Hillary lost, right? In 2016. And that's a big question mark, I think, for the Harris campaign, whether Harris can do as well with those voters. So I think represent that older base that sounds like your arguing Democrats may permanently lose. I'm particularly interested, not just in that cohort of voters, but also, as we've discussed before in the pod, the way that Trump is eating into Democrats' historic dominance among racial minorities and in a state like Pennsylvania, there are nearly 600,000 Latinos who are eligible to vote in this election. And you see the Harris campaign acknowledging that there aren't just Latino issues, right? The issues that all Pennsylvania's care about are the issues that Latinos care about as well. And yet, the Trump campaign is eating into what had historically been a quite strong democratic base for the reasons that you just described a race with a message that resonates with many working class voters. So that's another area of vulnerability for Dems and potential gain for the Republicans. number. Which is it? Hmm. I'm going to deflect. So while I was driving around Pennsylvania, I thought of the geekiest possible dad joke. Amazing. So lots of politicians are making trips to Pennsylvania. Which character from the Iliad, this Pennsylvania resemble and why? I'm going to deflect listeners. Okay, I'll tell you, Helen of Troy, because it's the state that launched a thousand for listeners how pained a dream looks. Do you see what I did there? I exchanged one form of geekery for another form of geekery and now we can just go straight to thank you. That's really had a couple taken away since 2020. Great sense. Everyone's leaving. I've been told. Okay, that's it for I'm doing well. I'm in New York. We're preparing for all of the world's leaders to descend next week, and that includes our editor-in-chief and also various heads of state and adress. So looking forward to having him. We're going to do events with Idris and Zanny and David Rennie and our colleagues, Sophie Petter. These are some of the people who've been covering big elections around the world this year. So we're doing one event in New York on the 24th and one in Washington on the 25th. If you'd like to attend, you can go to economist.com slash subscriber-events, and then you can navigate from there to the tickets page. around? I thought you're briefing on this was excellent adress. And I would just add to what you said that I think it's easy to think about 2021, January 6th, 2021 as a culmination of something. And rather, it was in many ways the beginning. I think the norm reflected, the shifting norm reflected in the fact that not only of course was there this riot and invasion of the Capitol, but more than a hundred members of the House voted against certifying the results of the election. That's a vote that usually is completely ceremonial. And then even after that, as you've written about a there were partisan reviews of ballots in crucial swing states, namely Maricopa County, in Arizona, where you had an audit conducted with an unclear source of funding by partisans. And so to echo your point, after this extraordinary test of American democracy in 2021, have the changes that have been instituted since then made America more or less vulnerable. And show that according to which state you're registered to vote in. Yeah, I think after the election in 2000, there was a reckoning with the very weird but basic problem that you can lose the popular vote, but still win the presidency. That problem is kind of familiar. The other problem that's kind of familiar is the idea that just a few swing states decide the election. So you have as few as several thousand people in a particular state with enormous power over the choice of who becomes president. But I think the other problem that has been laid bare particularly in the past three years is that the rules for administering elections vary so much from state to state. I mean, there are basic things like Maine and Nebraska are the only ones that let electoral votes be split among two candidates. Everyone else has a has a winner takes all system. But then you have specific rules that when an election is very closely contested and when you have actors as we do now who have shown what I'll call an interventionist approach to election results, those rules can really matter. So you see this in crucial swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania where there isn't a rule barring an elector from choosing a candidate who doesn't carry a state. So Adrie's what's your to read that. I enjoyed Ann Rose obituary as I always do. She wrote an obituary of Francisco LaPara who was a scientist who devoted his career just studying Alzheimer's, which is a disease that is understood, but which scientists have almost uniquely among major illnesses facing the world have been unable to really make progress on. And I very much admire all those who devote their careers to it, given how devastating a disease it is. But I found her obituary a beautiful read. of the candidates is incredibly important. Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think that Trump is very good at making himself the victim and he, in fairness, has recently been the victim twice with two assassination attempts since July. So that's not to be ignored, of course, but the claim that he is the victim of unfair dealings in the actual administration of an election is, of course, completely unfounded. And he has used, I think, three tactics here. So one is to change the rules, try to try to change the rules in the administration of elections. Two is to file lawsuits about given rules in particular states. And then three is the broader question of trust and election. So while trying to change the rules and filing various lawsuits, making statements that undermine broader trust in the outcome, i.e. if I win, it's fair. If I lose, there's been cheating. And the RNC co-chair said, as Adry says reported, in filing one of the lawsuits that in Michigan, Michigan was open for cheating. That was part of his announcement of that lawsuit. That's completely nonsensical, not least because the changes the lawsuit seeks wouldn't be in place for this election. I think that those are the three main areas of activity. And if you look at how the rules have changed, there has been a lot of activity in the past three years, right? So some states have moved to expand voting access to early voting, for instance. And then there have been other states that have past laws that I think move in the other direction. And there's been a particular friendly activity in swing states. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. So there's been a lot going on. Adries, how would you categorize the types of changes in those states? Yeah, geez, I have trouble getting my head around this because some of these changes seem, as you say, so marginal and also just so dull, right? I mean, it's hard to get into the weeds of this without feeling like you want to immediately go read something else. But actually, they, they could do kind of matter, right? I mean, in Georgia, state officials can now remove county level election officials in Arizona, there is a law now, right? That there can be criminal penalties for election workers who do relatively standard things like send a mail and ballot to a voter who didn't actively ask for one. Some of these changes just seem deeply odd on a number of levels and introduce at the very least, I think, a sense of fear among the people who are administering these elections and possibly intimidation. And I just have trouble gauging how much they matter. And I'm not sure whether we'll know until after election day. right since 2021 is not just the changes that we've seen on the state level, which we've discussed, but there also were changes on the federal level to make the discretion of Congress in certifying the election to limit it so that Congress would indeed have more of simply a ceremonial role in certifying the election rather than an empowered one in which they could use their judgment to potentially change the election's outcome. So now it used to be that only one member of each chamber needed to lodge a complaint. Now you need a fifth of members from each chamber. It's just becoming harder even if there were will within Congress to metal in the outcome. It is now legally more difficult than it was, but I agree with you, Adrice, there's no evidence from Democrats' past behavior or current statements that suggest they would forcibly try to change an obvious at least. And I think your distinction about the legal changes versus the broader PR effort is important. And I don't think we should diminish. I don't think you did, but I just want to underscore how important the broader PR move remains. Just the idea that there is a continuous push from this campaign to del legitimize the basic outcomes of the election is problematic. Not just because there may be real backlash after the election at a Harris win. And I think the Capitol will be well protected this time. People learn from January 6th, but I don't think we should rule out that there might be some level of unrest. But the point of politics is not actually about the horse race. It's about what comes next. It's about the person in the White House who has the ability to help America deal with very, very big problems in the 21st century. And if you have a huge share of the country who just doesn't think that that person is legitimately elected. And there are people within the party who continue to pledge guilty to Donald Trump because to a point that has been made by some of our colleagues, Donald Trump may continue to seek power again. It's not out of the realm of possibility that Trump or a member of his family remains in American politics and continues to perpetuate this lie that he deserves to be in power. I just think that adds a toxicity to the job of governing. You can't actually do anything or it's much harder to get things done in that environment. So I think the communications effort that Donald Trump wages extremely well becomes not just a matter of comms and PR, but a matter of substance because of what it does to the Ford? I think it would have been LBJ. He wasn't born in the 19th century, was he? nine years between them. I should have answered that more confidently. I would say LBJ. Okay, 19... 1910? 11. What was the year? Oh, I know this. Hold on. 1948? No, I think it's later than that. I think it's... I'll say... By a hair. By a hair. I'll take it. Excellent. Actually, I think Adrice you should just contest the results. I am in Washington because Idris and some of our other colleagues did a live event that I helped organize last night with several hundred people there to talk about the impact of elections around the world. It was really great and it was great to see in particular certain listeners who lent me some moral support for my performance in trivia. I continue to get a kick out of the fact that I spent 20 years of the Economist rating cover stories on Saudi Aramco and the only thing I'm known for is being bad at quizzes but moving on. And I take issue with your definition of woke, so I'm looking forward to chatting with you. So hard being a man. John, you're also in the US. I don't know where you are. You're in Pennsylvania somewhere. I guess I don't think the idea of walkness is inherently pessimistic. And I think it actually is grounded in the idea that there is progress to be made. So the argument is that there are inequities in American life that deserve acknowledgement and attention. And so I think it's right that there are problems with racial inequality as one example in American life. And the debate is over how best to solve it. I think that's where the movement of walkness runs into trouble. I will say that I think the chronology of when this phenomenon took off is important. So it was really from 2014, where you had some instances that were I think hard for white America to ignore. So with the election of Barack Obama, you had people talking about a post-racial America and so forth. And I think that's an argument that many black Americans found to be odd. Then in 2014, you had the shooting of an 18-year-old Mike Brown, you had a shooting of a child, later, Traymon Martin, culminating with the death of George Floyd, where people could hear a man pleading for his mother as a policeman had his knee on his neck. And then, concurrent with that, you had the rise of Trump, who was either explicitly or implicitly making racist comments. And I think for many white liberals, these were disorienting phenomena that coincided. And you saw their opinion of racial issues actually move to the left of the opinion of black and Hispanic voters as they kind of developed ideas about how best to solve all the sudden to them seemed like huge glaring problems, but actually had been lurking within American life for longer. I'm going to plug something that is not new, and which I've plugged before, but which I recently re-read and I found to be so good, which was our series of briefs on AI. And I think that there's so much hype about AI and pessimism and despair and some of the articles that you read can be quite superficial without getting into the meat of the technology and its deeper questions and implications. And I just found this set of six stories to be the essential reading for understanding this rapidly changing technology. So, recommend people go read them. I am interested in a slightly different way I guess which is that I find this phenomena super interesting and I think the idea of the way that America's institutions of power grapple with it is important and I think that the way the right has seized on it potentially has enormous implications not just for the way that an election might go but in the laws that different states pass that are supposedly in response to wokeery but have potentially broader impacts and it used to be that the Republican Party could use abortion rights as a way to drive turnout and if not obscure questions about economic policy at least win over some segments of the electorate who they knew would be really mobilized by anti-abortion advocates who would be really mobilized by that issue above all others and I think that's so useful about wokeness now or the charge of rampant wokeery throughout American life by the right is that it's so clearly yoked to the elite so it makes it even more enticing as an issue to amplify within the right and within conservative rallies I mean you have seen over the past few years if there's any problem in America you can tie it back if you're ingenious enough to wokeness ainsley pointed out in her briefing the bridge collapse that we saw you know that was a problem of wokeness because of hiring practices that were tied to racial requirements so you know the right has really really seized on this and you have a huge number of different activities that have been happening on the state level whether it is banning certain AP courses in African-American studies or you have the laws that Governor DeSantis has passed in Florida there's a lot of action here yet one of the from where she was in not just the the primary for the 2020 run but how she was presented in the general you know it's not that surprising that she tacked to the left in the primary when she was seeking the presidential nomination then but at the democratic national convention in 2020 just a few months after George Floyd the introduction of her was really downplaying her role as a prosecutor and talking about social justice that's of course so different from how she was presented this time around where she really has tried to embrace the old big tent model of the democratic party and Tim Walls has done that as well he talks a lot about neighbors having different opinions but still looking out for each other there's an idea that the democratic party can take in different points of view and welcome all so I think that that is clearly a big shift I think the thing that is probably most thorny now for Democrats that wasn't the case in 2020 is the question of anti-semitism and the way that Israel fits into the oppressor oppressed argument so I think Harris has navigated that pretty definitely actually and I was interested at the DNC one Chuck Schumer who is the senior most Jewish person in government had a long discussion of anti-semitism without actually mentioning Israel at all and this distinction between anti-semitism and anti-zionism that's one that the democratic party has implicitly tried to make in its public statements but I think that that current manifestation of the oppressor oppressed argument is probably the most political salient one now within the democratic party. Itrish there has been an incredibly I feel like a member of the college educated elite who's going through her own neurotic proximate of whatever it is that you just said that college educated elites were doing but I think that there's a weird thing here which is counterproductive in that the culture of victimhood across political parties is just insidious and stupid technical term so Republicans think that white people are more discriminated against than black people right that's a fact that's a miserable effect in polling so there are huge partisan differences in the perception of discrimination if you look at differences among young men versus young women most young women would identify themselves as feminists just four years ago it used to be that young men would describe themselves that way too and now they don't right this is from the survey center on American life in 2019 less than a third of young men said that they experienced some or a lot of discrimination in American society just four years later nearly half of men said that men faced gender-based discrimination so there's a lot of I think a perception that whatever group you're in in some way you are aggrieved and that's not it's just not a phenomenon exclusively on the left it's very much on the right too and Donald Trump is the victim in chief right so I think there's something insidious here and there's a real opportunity for leaders to talk not about coddling specific subgroups but passing broad policies to help Americans writ large regardless of their particular group to advance and so less talk of systemic racism more talk of the poverty tax credit as an example you know so I think that Democrats are moving in that direction I think that is really ridiculous okay I'm gonna go for radicchio I'm trying to think of rainbow colors radicchio avocado there was avocado smoked salmon uh what else is called tomato yeah that's it"

        "text_corpus": " What's up in Washington? Washington is good. I just got back from Pittsburgh which I really like. I spent a summer there many years ago in turning for the local paper. I really like it. I think it's one of these charming cities that has a lot of beauty that people don't appreciate. There's something about the hills and the bridges and everything. Also it peaked at the right time which is important. You want a city that peaked around Art Deco time, not a city that peaked around brutalism time. That's very bad. This episode of the Yes, I went to Erie, which is a very beautiful corner of Pennsylvania right on the Great Lake. And there too, you hear very similar points being made about where Harris is. She has some offices there and where Trump isn't. So he's still relying on a lot of in-person visits. He visited Erie last weekend. He's going back to Butler, Pennsylvania this weekend, which is, of course, where he nearly lost his life. So I think that'll be quite a rally to see. It makes sense that a lot of Trump in particular and Harris are both spending time in Pennsylvania for our model. I think there's about a three in ten chance that it's the tipping point state that decides who the next president is going to be. So that's why they're spending so much time there. In Trump's case, if he wins Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina, you would have 270. So that would be a pathway for him to win. That probably is the most natural pathway. For Harris, if she wins Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin and keeps Nebraska to, I think she also gets 270. So both of them have a very reliable path that goes through Pennsylvania, which is why they're spending as much I liked our long piece about the new Japanese Prime Minister Shiba, who's going to be taking over pretty soon, who's going to have to deal with a new American president. He's a little bit more of a defense hawk. It was a good introduction to him and the issues that he'll be facing soon. Yeah, about two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton went on MSNBC and gave an interview and she had a comment on misinformation that a lot of people in the conservative news environment really were outraged by. And I think that's what you're hearing, although the call for camps I think is new, at least to me. What she said in that interview was that the Russians had interfered in the election in 2016. And then this is her full quote. She said, quote, I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda and whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence because the Russians are unlikely, except in a very few cases to ever stand trial in the United States. So that is what got lots of people I rate and that is filtered down as you can see to people who are actively be gone. So, you know, that's why there's some hedging. It will only take place if Harris wins. And unfortunately, I think that there are rules in Pennsylvania that are actual breeding grounds for, you know, misinformation and doubt. You know, Pennsylvania doesn't allow mail and ballots to be pre-counted. So that creates this perception that on election day, because Republicans are more likely to turn out that, you know, the count starts red and it gets progressively bluer. That's a big Yeah, that's right. I went back to Pittsburgh where I spent a fun summer when I was in college and now I'm back reporting. So that was fun. One of the first stops was with a Harris campaigner named Bri Erskin. She very politely let me shadow her as she canvassed in the borough of Bellevue, which is in the western part of Pennsylvania. And we talked on a busy road on a rainy day. had. Democrat Chris Delusio represents Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district that takes in Pittsburgh suburbs. Some of them are wealthier, some of them working class. Joe Biden won that district in 2020, but it's a much tougher place for Democrats to win than the center of the city when we met in an office in the Union Hall after Delusio had just delivered remarks before retired educators. He told And a government that serves them well. There's this growing deployment divide in America where college educated voters are increasingly gravitating to the Democratic Party. And those without dance degrees are increasingly gravitating. It's about the party. It's going to reverse the polarity that existed for a while. You can't win a district like yours with just college educated If you look at the electoral map of Western Pennsylvania, you will see a sea of red with two exceptions, Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh and a large chunk of the 17th congressional district, but also Eri tucked in the northwest corner of the state. Eri is also one of only two counties aside from Northampton County in the east that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and then switched to Joe Biden in 2020. Trump held a rally in Eri last weekend and it's a perfect bell weather for the state. I talked to Jeff Bloodworth who's a professor of American political history at Ganon University in the city of Eri, which sits very picturesquely on the shores of the Great Lake. We met in a busy Turkish bakery not far from campus where he told me why the area is so in terms of whether or not Democrats actually show up here? You know, do you see them. It's a propable weather. Yes, that's right for all the reasons that he pointed out. It's also the largest county in Pennsylvania. So it just does expand and include, you know, it has a mini city, it has many suburbs, it has burl areas outside of it. So it's a good barometer for the rest of the state. And that's why you've seen Donald Trump spend as much time there as he has. I thought Jeff was really, really good. And one of the things he said at the end about whether or not Trump propels you or attracts you, I think, is a good framework. But the other thing that occurred to me as you go around the state is people are very concerned about economics and inflation. But it's also, I think, a kind of deeper cultural attachment. And it's interesting. You see that reflected in the slogans of both candidates. So Trump is keeping make America great again. And Harris is supposed to be, we're not going back. And I think it's why does education become the dividing line that it has. I think it's that for a lot of people, the past looks rozier than the present. And for others, you know, generally people with college degrees, the future seems better than the past. And people want restoration in the Trump case. And in the democratic case, people want, you know, what they think of his progress. And that to me seems like the big dividing line. I mean, people will handle over inflation and whatnot. But that seems to me to be not kind of the core issue that we're talking about today. Actually, John and your interviews when people are saying, you know, there's too much illegal immigration. There's transgender ideology in schools. I mean, that seems to me to be what people are really kind of arguing about or at least the partisans, of course, you know, it probably won't be up to the partisans. But that was what was interesting to me from going and government intervention. Yeah, that's right. And Harris gave a speech in Pittsburgh where she laid out her new economic policy, which like you said, has an emphasis on unions. I find the democratic embrace of unions a kind of last grasp almost. Democrats are undergoing this big transition where they are becoming the party of the college educated, the managerial class, and they're transitioning out of being a working class party. And that's a problem for them because they're just aren't as many college-educated Americans as there are non-college-educated Americans. And you see already the teamsters not endorsing Harris because their members are blue collar without degrees and they're drifting pretty substantially towards Donald Trump. Democrats are promising lots of really good economic incentives for working class Americans and yet they seem to be losing their grip on them. And that's why I think they're trying and they're fighting as hard as they are to try to keep them. And I think it makes sense, right? You don't want to do what Hillary Clinton did and totally consign whole swath of the country off to the other side. You need to cut into your margins and you need to come up with policies that try to appeal even if you're not going to be all that successful because, you know, in a state like Pennsylvania, every vote in every place will count. Yeah, I guess that Yes, disproportionately in Philadelphia. But one thing that was of interest that came up in a few conversations is the fact that Democratic turnout in Philadelphia itself has not been as high as some would like. And the success overall in the Philadelphia suburbs has masked the fact that the Democratic machine within Philadelphia has perhaps not been doing all it needs to do to get the top candidates over the line, which I thought is interesting. And particularly, people are worried about support among African Americans in the city and turnout Hispanic Americans in the city and also working class whites who in the Northwest part of the city, which is all very interesting. People sort of think of Philadelphia as ironclad for Democrats, but maybe there is some to think. I was like New York, no Texas, no question two. Six states, as well as DC, have just three Wyoming, and Delaware. Oh, well done, Adres. Yeah, those. And, uh, um, uh, Vermont. most electoral college votes in order? California, New York Texas. No, uh, no, California, Texas, How were your travels? It was good. I went to Atlanta for a few days. I hung out with our colleague, Becca Jackson, which was a lot of fun, went to a couple of nice restaurants. Atlanta's doing really well, so it was a lot of fun to be around there. as far as they did? So the main vulnerability with the system is that it runs on good faith and that it's incredibly antiquated. So the electoral college was created in the constitution. That's how states actually select their president, the actual mechanics of it, which I think we're going to get into are pretty complicated. And there are many steps. So every state is running their own election essentially. They are picking not the president, but they are picking their slate of electors that go to the electoral college. They all have to vote in mid-December. Those votes are then transmitted to Congress and Congress then counts those votes on January 6th in accordance with the 12th amendment and later laws that were passed. And so what happened in 2020 was that Donald Trump lost. He lost in many states, often by tight margins, but in many states nonetheless. And what he tried to do was he didn't concede. And that's something that has happened every time in American politics, but he didn't concede. And he tried to exploit the process to try to overturn the result. And so each of those steps that were just antiquated formalities before became opportunities for him to try to overturn the election, try to pursue the legal ambiguity to its breaking point. And that's what he did. So in Georgia, he called Brad Raffensberger, who was the secretary of state, who's the chief elections officer. He asked him to find 12,000 or so votes that were needed to overturn the result. Raffensberger didn't comply neither to Brian Kemp, neither to Jeff Duncan. And then he pivoted to a new theory, which was that vice president Mike Pence could essentially refuse to count the electoral college votes of the states in which he lost other Republicans mounted legal challenges that didn't come to anywhere. But ultimately the legal theories weren't all that serious. But what it did do was engender this idea that it's still present among Republicans, 70% of whom think that the election was stolen. And that process, that stopped the steel process, culminated of course in the attack on the Capitol on January 6th. But it hasn't dissipated within the Republican Party. Trump is again the nominee. The party has spent a lot of time sewing doubt in the electoral process. And this time around, this is what the cover piece was supposed to be about. What's going to happen? What can we say and how secure are our elections this time take? So a lot of this goes back to the original design of the Constitution. So the reason that it varies state by state is that the Constitution was a federal document and it's specifically an article one. It says that states decide the manner and place of elections, but Congress gets to decide the date and the electoral college itself actually doesn't have any requirement that there be a popular vote. In fact, at the start of the Republic state legislatures would just appoint the people who would cast the states vote for president. And that was never changed. So the senators used to be picked by the state legislature. That was then modified by I think the 17th amendment to require popular vote. There is no requirement of that. And there's no specification of how those electors are supposed to be decided. And so really states could decide to allocate them however they wish as long as they pass that law before the election. And if your eyes are starting to glaze over with how complicated it is, that is part of the problem as well. The fact that this is baked into the Constitution makes it a lot harder to change as well. My eyes were not glazing over. It on our AI school's briefs, basically catching up on what's been going on in the rapidly changing world of generative AI and all of its applications. It's one of these spaces where if you look away for a few months, you come back and everything has shifted its place. So it was very, very helpful So it depends on the state legislature and who is in charge. So Democrats have largely been expanding vote by mail. Whereas Republicans have been emphasizing voter ID, including for voting by mail. You saw that in Georgia where there was a bill passed SP 202. They got quite a lot of attention two years ago. It didn't have the kind of vote suppression effect that Democrats claimed. And I think actually that's a somewhat pernicious and corrosive idea that I think Democrats have largely moved away from. You don't see much discussion about in part because there's been so much voter turnout. I would say on the whole the voting laws have been tweaked on the margins. Sometimes it unhelpful ways. So in Pennsylvania, for example, county officials cannot pre-process mail in ballots and this sounds boring. But that means that they can't start verifying the signatures and start counting them until election day itself. And that is what creates this blue shift where the Democrats, at least in the last election, probably this one tend to vote by mail a lot more. They tend to cast more provisional ballots. If they're not counted immediately, what you'll see is a vote tally that starts out more Republican leaning and gets gradually more democratic leading. And you saw that in Arizona last time. And that is cited. That's the number one thing that people who think that the election is being stolen will will cite. They'll say, okay, on election night, Trump was winning in Pennsylvania and he was winning in Arizona and then lo and behold four or five days later, it's changed. And because of this process that actually you can't approve. I mean, Florida, which had famously badly run elections for a while, is now incredibly fast because they've changed these kind of mechanical procedures such that they can count them a lot quicker. The changes that have been made to the voting system as a whole, I think are fairly marginal. America? Do they have some fair points? I think some of them do on narrow points, but I think it's one thing to say that voter rolls are badly maintained by states. So the list of people who are eligible to vote in a state is an updated to account for people moving between states. Often it isn't often updated to account for people dying. That doesn't mean that those people who are on the rolls are then giving fraudulent votes, but it is true that the voter rolls are frankly a mess. And I think anyone would tell you that. And I guess if you go point by point, you will see similar kinds of issues, right? Where there are states that do send out ballots or ballot requests to people who probably shouldn't receive them. Now it's probably not the case that that is amounting to fraud that is so serious that it's flipping elections. And I think that's basically the point at which they lose me. It's not that there are ways that elections could be improved. And I think they could be. I mean, the problem is not really with mechanics. It's with the narrative that's constructed. And if you want to construct a narrative at which elections are routinely stolen, I mean, that's the thing that's really, really catastrophic. century. So the vice president is supposed to count the certificates of electors on January 6th. And that process had worked up until 1876, which was this very contested election in which three states submitted alternative slates of electors. And Congress was basically stuck on who the next president would be. And they had to appoint a commission to figure it out that ultimately went for Rutherford B. Hayes. But to resolve these ambiguity, they passed this law of the electoral count act, which was supposed to govern how the counting actually worked. That law had also a lot of issues, which no one bothered to exploit until Donald Trump did. People like Richard Nixon basically would certify their own losses. He was the first one to do that in over century, but Al Gore did that as well in 2000. And so what the electoral counter format does, and this also gets very complicated. But it removes some of the potential loopholes and ambiguities that exist in the electoral count act. So for example, under the old regime, only a single senator or a single house member could raise objections to the counting of a state electoral college votes. Now the rule is that one fifth of each chamber has to agree in order for the Congress to start debating that point. It also tries to eliminate the chance that governors will sort of the wrong slate of electors. And it clarifies that the vice president's role is ministerial, rather than directly choosing who the next president is. This is the first election that's going to be run under these rules. And a lot of legal scholars think that helpfully tightened up the rules in advance of that. But there might be more ambiguities that we just haven't thought of yet. Okay, Idris, over to you. Who are we going to hear from next? We're going to hear from Jamie Raskin. He's a Democratic congressman from Maryland who sat on the January 6th committee. He also led the impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump for his role in those events shortly after. And we spoke about what his concerns are ahead of this election, particularly if Kamala Harris were to win November and Donald Trump again disputed the results. Can you say a bit more about that rickety process and infrastructure? So obviously, last time around Trump tried to exploit some of the ambiguities within the electoral account act that was supposed to be fixed with the electoral account reform act states of also tweaking their laws. How rickety is it now after all of that? Look, the cleanest way to demands, which is what Mike Pence did. You just said it won't be exactly the same as what we saw last time. So what is it that you're kind of most worried about this time around if it's going to be different from what we saw in the previous time? Well, I mean, I'm nervous about simply not being I think ultimately they would. Democrats have a lot of experience of winning the popular vote in losing the electoral college that happened to Al Gore. It happened to Hillary Clinton. Both of them conceded after exhausting legal challenges. And in Hillary's case, she didn't really mount a legal challenge. It was pretty clear that she had lost and she wasn't going to be able to overturn it. So I think that the most important step, which is that the loser concedes would happen. I think Vice President Harris would do that. There's a sub speculation that Democrats might be tempted by the playbook that Donald Trump attempted to unveil in 2020 and argue that maybe Donald Trump isn't qualified to be president because he's an insurrectionist as defined by section 3 of the 14th Amendment and that therefore if they controlled Congress, they would try to instruct the Vice President not to count those votes for him. I think that's not going to happen. I don't think Democrats are going to lose the presidency and be in a majority in both houses of Congress anyway. I don't think that they would really attempt to do that. When Democrats do lose, they, you know, I think you can look at the kind of Russia interference investigations as 2016 as a kind of way to rationalize what would happen. I think that that's what they move towards rather than actually attempting to subvert the election outcome. The only thing that has happened Well, I don't think that the outcome itself would be overturned just as there wasn't a legal risk of that happening last time. I don't think that there is very much of one this time. And most law professors who think about this stuff day in a day out agree with that assessment. But I do think that there is just this last time a lot of capacity for public mistrust, capacity for violence as well and unrest and most corrosively that half the country might still believe that the second election was stolen. That would be really, really bad. So what concretely am I worried about this time? Well, the RNC has filed lawsuits over 100 in many states arguing that various aspects of election administration are wrong or may lead to fraud. In a lot of cases, you know, the legal challenges are not going very far. But if Trump loses, I think that these could form breadcrumbs essentially. People arguing that see we tried to warn you that, for example, one of the cases is in Arizona about whether or not illegal immigrants are voting. And if a judge doesn't change the law as the RNC likes or change the rules, you could see Donald Trump arguing, look, we try to fix it and the Democrats and Charity election system didn't fix it. I think that would be how they would go about it. In terms of actual governors or secretaries of state refusing to certify, I again don't think that would happen. So in 2022, a lot of Republicans were handpicked by Trump to basically pledge to overturn elections that he lost in. People like Carrie Lake in Arizona, Doug Masteryano and Pennsylvania, we can go down the list, but all of them lost in Georgia, especially. So the risk is not at the state or secretary state level. I think that you will see if Trump loses some counties refuse to certify their results. You've already seen that happen in 2022. Individual members on election boards, individual counties trying to not certify in order to delay the results. I also don't think that that's going to amount to a serious delay in the whole process, but I think that you will see signs like that that emerge. But on the whole election denial is a public relations game more than it is a legal one. I think the legal ability to overturn an election is still pretty limited. And I actually think that Supreme Court and federal judges, including Republican appointed federal judges, they understand the seriousness of these cases. I think they take their oath of office a lot more seriously than members of Congress. I'm actually quite sanguine about how they would deal with these challenges. If it's very clear who won and who lost. I think that's a really good point Was it... He was Eisenhower's vice president. I think he was like 40. So I'm going to say... Idris, how are you doing? I'm doing well. I'm recovering from having to show my face in front of a crowd of larger than five people. So yeah, it's been good. It's actually tough. I was complaining to Charlotte. I've had to wear a suit and tie like three consecutive days. I agree with Charlotte that it's about heightened attention to inequalities, but I think that the element that is unique is it's finding that this is the result of systemic discrimination and prejudice and bias that systems of oppression exist. And that is what causes these disparities. So I think that that is what differentiates it from a good liberal, I think ought to be concerned by inequality and want to correct it and want to improve it, particularly along lines of race and gender. But I think that when we talk about what is woke specifically, I think it is that identification that things are systemic and that systems need to change in order to correct for those disparities. And that's why I think you see the resorting to these means that I think classical liberal would not go with treating group identity as quite important, ensuring balancing demographically across elite sets, all of that is there. And then I think also depending on how much you think of walkness as a coherent ideological project, if you look at its roots in things like critical race theory, critical theory, postmodernism, etc. I think that there is actually quite a lot of pessimism in that people like Derek Bell are writing about how the civil rights movement was only done because it benefited whiteness as a whole. So I think that depending on how much you think modern practitioners are rooted in that intellectual tradition, I think that there is actually a kind of currency there that is actually kind of pessimistic about society's capacity to change. I think also it's interesting to think about what has prompted its decline. So one is lack of popularity in 2020. There was a big movement towards basically instituting affirmative action in corporate hiring, getting as close as that as possible that I think dissipated in part because market conditions are outward. But two, in the political realm, you know, black lives matter was ascendant, the organization itself. It's since basically collapsed. Its founders have had various scandals and whatnot. So I think that that has taken the impetus out of the movement, even though the level of police killings of unarmed people is roughly the same. But then also it politically became grafted onto all sorts of ideas that were entirely unworkable like defunding the police, like abolishing ICE, all of which I think there was a significant backlash to. So it makes sense to me, and obviously we saw what happened in media organizations like The New York Times. It makes sense to me that there would be a decline in interest in those things since then. What I worry about is its calcification in institutions like universities or NGOs, places where the profit mode of doesn't really kind of iron things out over the long run. So you've seen the codification of diversity statements in a lot of university departments. So even if there aren't these kind of loud declarations of principles and statements, I do think that there's a chance of this becoming bureaucratized in a way that actually saps the vitality of academic institutions in particular, but in politics and in business, I think that this has been relatively self-correcting. Hey, Jiz, how about you? I think our coverage of the reforms going on in Mexico right now under Amlone, the waiting days of his administration has been very good. It's pretty concerning changing the way the judges are elected, militarizing the National Guard, and all in a year where people might be distracted by other things. And I think we haven't lost sight of what's going on in the rest of the world. history at times of elite over production? I think it's a really original and really thought-provoking thesis I really enjoyed his work through it. I think there hasn't been a lot of careful sociological attention to this issue even though it's probably one of the most important intellectual changes of our lifetime really and it's hard to study it from a kind of remove in part because actually within sociology departments itself it's so baked in at some point right if you go to a sociology conference the entire thing is basically a kind of study of oppression and so I like the vantage point that he's assumed and I think the examples from history are particularly interesting and it does capture the sense that a lot of these debates are intra elite fights about position within elite institutions. I think that does map on very well to what we see now that's why you seek affirmative action at elite universities being the epicenter of a lot of this conflict or positions at Fortune 500 companies are hiring at Facebook and Meta and tech companies and all the rest I think that does capture something or within newspapers as well right who has power with an institution is it the old guard or is it a new guard using new set of arguments I think it's very instructive for that reason. He also points out on the book a very nice quote from George Orwell in the road to Wig and Pier about his dislike for middle class socialists who he thinks were adopting the phrase and cause of the day basically to secure their own position. He has a quote that's very good sometimes when I listen to these people talk and still more when I read their books I get the impression that to them the whole socialist movement is no more than a kind of exciting heresy hunt a leaping to and fro a frenzied witch doctors to the beat of Tom Thompson the tune of Fee 5.0 from I smelled the blood of a right wing deviationist which you know baps on very well to say switer politics I think. in that light yeah I think that's totally right the temptation is to use the illiberal means of the other side for your own ends you see that with the banning of certain kinds of speech the banning of certain kinds of practices in education even at the university level to some extent all in the name of kind of defeating this ideology which I think is incorrect I think it's important to scrutinize it on its own terms what does it mean what does it say what recommendations does it have because I think it's not just a matter of like the wrong people oppose it I think even within the left it's provoked I think a good amount of resistance within the academy within newspapers within companies as well so I think there is a liberal kind of alternative I think it's important it's been on the back foot because not just in America but across the world you know the idea of using illiberal means to stamp out all dissent is just very alluring and that's an impulse that goes back very far I'm always struck by the first Protestants people like John Calvin kind of asserted right to descend for themselves but then immediately set up like a dictatorial state to stamp out all dissenters to their dissent and I think you have something like that that happens it's just a part of human nature it's deeply kind of a antithetical to human nature to try to be open to free speech and free ideas that you oppose and yet that's what I think liberalism is supposed to mechanism has worked which is good. Yeah yeah I think that it definitely has self-corrected it does make you slightly question the judgment of politicians who are of course there to lead not be led by the ideas of the day I think to go back to what Musa was saying the emergence of this trend within elites coincided with also the increase in educational polarization as Democrats became the party of the college educated and so they reflected in that sense the peroxisms and erosies of the college educated as well and I think that that adversely affected the Clinton campaign as well it adversely affected the 2020 democratic primary campaign I think the hangover that probably depressed Joe Biden's foe tally in 2020 even though he won narrowly and it's good from a practical point that they've realized that a lot of the stuff is unpopular and self-corrected this time but I do wish that there had been a kind of independent judgment shown to buck this trend I mean if you parse the comments of Barack Obama during this period you will see some subtle criticisms of this line of thinking but he was not out there you know I guess he's not the leader of the party but he was not pushing it and there wasn't really that much pushback within the left one I think it would have been helpful for this to have crested sooner not just because this is a symbolic point or because liberalism is important but also because I think you can point to concrete harms that have been enacted a dearth of policing is not good I think for poor Americans I think affirmative action of these sort of solutions don't really help the median minority of American we can go down the list but I'm glad that it is self-corrected 2017 um I would go slightly earlier maybe maybe 2016 or 2015 2017 is correct Miriam Webster now bill's title stand for I don't know that one do you address something our kids act yeah that's"

        "text_corpus": " Like any big city, London can be a very hectic place. Take a short trip out of the city centre and you'll find yourself in a completely different kind of sensory environment. Over 300 acres of sprawling green space, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Q, housed the largest and most diverse collection of plants and fungi in the world. There are steamy tropical rainforests encased in ornate Victorian glass houses and flowery woodlands dotted with corpses and ponds. Walking into Q Gardens can feel like stepping into an alternate reality. It's little wonder then, if so many people come here to wonder its verdant trails. This draw to natural spaces is a common theme around the world. Our guest this week is Kathy Willis, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford and a former director of science at Q Gardens. Like many ecologists, Kathy has spent much of her career investigating the impact humans have had on the health of the environment. But she's also been studying that question the other way around. How plants can influence the health of people. In her new book Good Nature, Kathy argues that our bodies and brains may have evolved to find the natural world therapeutic. Bringing nature into our lives therefore could make us healthier. In this episode we'll look at why trees are good for hospital patients. Whether birdsong can reduce pain. And what exactly your houseplants are doing for your microbiome. I'm Alok Jar and this is Babbage from the Economist. Today, while we all need a prescription for nature. Kathy, well let's thank you for joining me on Babbage. Can you start by just telling me what is the power of a good walk through nature? I think that listeners hearing all of this will probably intuitively know that walking through nature makes them feel better and more calm. But can you give me an overview of what the science actually says about the connections between the two? Well, let's unpack some of that because it feels like again intuitively we know these things. The first thing that you get told if you're in a bad mood is to go and get some fresh air, go outside. But you talked about how even in the case of the patients seeing green helps them recover faster. What's going on in that person's body? Is it physiological? Is it mental? How deep does this go in terms of the knowledge we have about it? Yeah, exactly. Because there's lots of things going on to enliven your senses, I guess. There's maybe some creatures as well, different colours, smells, sights, sounds. Is this just because they've been sniffing it, basically? I mean, with those, you say that they have similar effects to a pharmaceutical. Now, of course, pharmaceuticals, when they're prescribed or given out by a pharmacist or whoever, they're very carefully doled out. When you say that these chemicals that are floating around in nature, that you're breathing, whether it's lavender or whatever else, well, we're not talking about extreme effects here, are we? Is it just effects of the edges? Well, when you say that they're similar to the pharmaceuticals, what do you mean by that? Okay, let's go into some of the specific health benefits then. So first of all, the colour green, green as in nature, is there something special about that? Is there something about the way that things look that energises our brain in some way? Yes, it makes us feel better. Do you know why? That's fascinating. And suggests a very easy thing for people to do when building schools. We talked about natural plants, of course, but do fake plants have similar effects? No. So I would know though, it was fake somehow. Just get real ones. Just get real ones. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Well, let's move on to another of our senses then sound. And given this as a podcast, of course, this is where we get interested in this topic. I suppose if anyone's been to a yoga studio, they'll have heard the trickling of water in the background or those sorts of natural sounds. Is there evidence to back up that those things can put you in a calming, happier mood? So what do we know about the health and cognitive or other benefits of these pleasant sounds, birds, songs and so on? And also traffic noise and other city noises has been shown to increase your general levels of stress. Yes. And if you don't consciously aware of it. And to the point where it might even shorten life in some ways. Now one element of the sound which I found fascinating is about pain management. Yes. And this sounds kind of crazy to me that you say in the book that hearing nature actually reduces how much we experience pain. Can you talk to me about that? So what I'm hearing is that there's a lot of benefit to hearing the sounds of nature, especially things like songbirds and water and all these things. Which again, makes sense intuitively. What I'm wondering is if you're sitting in your office and playing music in your headphones probably, would it be better to sort of just listen to bird song instead when you're working with that make you a more productive or calm person? I guess that what that question is leading to is is looking at nature from your window and hearing it from your window. Is that enough or is there actually genuinely more benefit to just going outside, which is what we're talking about right the beginning, which is walking outside is clearly beneficial. But if you were to sort of see it through a window. Yes, experience it through a window. Is that as beneficial? I guess also proximity, you know, being right up next to plants and experiencing these things. Does that have a factor in compared to just seeing something from a distance or being far away from it? And since we're going through the senses, what about touch? Touching leaves, touching earth, all of that, it must be good for you. I mean, I want to just say that that just sounds bonkers, but also great. That's incredible. And you know, when it comes to other things like soil or other things, you know, I'm not saying people should walk around shoving their hands into the soil. But that can be beneficial too. This sort of speaks a little bit to the idea that people might be familiar with about the hygiene hypothesis. Yes. That you should let kids play dirt basically or not protect them too much from those things because it allows their microbiome, it allows their immune system just to get used to the world around them. And therefore, we get more robust as well. The cleaning things too much is not necessarily that healthy. Just to make sure you don't mean just mean a wall painted green. No, sorry, this is a biology speaking. You've given me so many examples of the benefits of touching, smelling, seeing plants, soil, nature, just stepping back from it all. But what can we say about why these things happen? Is it because we ourselves, our animals that have evolved in an environment and we've had these things throughout our evolutionary history? And therefore it makes complete sense that the environment that we're in would have impacts on our health. What do we know about that part of all of this? As you demonstrated with all the examples. Let's talk about what all this translates into in terms of what societies people can do with this information. At the society level, what do you think that policymakers and others should be thinking about? Are we talking about the importance of green spaces and parks? What kinds of things are we talking about? Yeah, as we demonstrated. And what about individuals then? What kinds of things can we be doing to really improve the day-to-day lives of work or at home? Now this might sound like an odd question to ask an expert, a professor of biodiversity. But you're a paleoicologist. So you know, someone who studies ancient plants, fossil plants, you've worked at the Cue Gardens, which is one of the nicest places in all of Britain I have to say. Did writing this book and collecting all the evidence about the scientific arguments for the benefits of nature? Did that change your relationship with nature? And I tell you why I think it's a strange question because I assume your relationship with nature is very robust and you knew about it already. Kathy, thank you very much for your time. That's all from us. Now, just before you go, we've got some exciting news to share with you. Babbage has just won podcast of the year at the Medical Journalist Association Awards for our episode on bacteria fages. These are viruses that can destroy superbugs. They could make a difference in the ever more pressing problem of antimicrobial resistance. Make sure you go back and check out that episode. It's called How to Battle Superbugs with viruses, and we released it in May 2023. Thanks for listening. Babbage is produced by Canal Patel and Jason Hoskin. With mixing and sound design by Nico Roefast. The executive producer is Hannah Moreno. I'm Alok Jar, and in London, this is the Economist. Shilor's Chitness is the economist's global business correspondent. Those machines are doing a task so complicated that you might wonder if they were breaking wafer itself. The lasers that Shilash saw were building integrated circuits on wafers of silicon, carving out transistors and the wiring to connect them. In other words, they were making computer chips. You probably don't spend too much time thinking about computer chips, but increasingly these wafers of silicon are responsible for pretty much everything we do in the digital age. And with the rise of AI and its enormous appetite for processing power, these chips are being pushed to their limits. But that can't go on forever. To maintain the gains in performance just as computing is getting ever more intensive, chip makers are having to get creative. I'm Alok Jha and this is Babbage from the Economist. Today, the hardware breakthroughs that AI and the rest of the digital world desperately need. We heard from Shilash Chitnis a moment ago and he's here with me now. Thanks for joining me, thanks for having me. Now, Shilash, you've spent the last few months writing a multi-part story, a technology quarterly, as we call them here at the Economist, on the future of chip making. And we're going to dive into that in today's show. Before we start though, can you tell listeners why computer chips are something very close to your heart? They're more than just something of Who old is it magnitude away? That's right. You could still be very young because well, you asked a very young but the point is that this stuff moves incredibly fast. in the introduction what a modern chip making factory is like. But what was it like 20 years ago when harder and harder. This is what we're going to talk about for the rest of today's program. But before we get into all the details, I think it's probably worth stepping back and just explaining to the wall on the same page. What computer chips actually are? We have this sort of vague idea that they're in lots of devices and they've been around for a long time but what is a computer chip? How is it structured and where do I find them? Basically computer chips are everywhere. Any are then fed to the processor to do its thing. Okay and these are all on the same chip. Now one of the things that people might have heard quite often is that the phones in our pocket, smartphones have more processing power than the computers that we used to send people to the moon during the Apollo missions. What has made micro-processes improved so much from the 60s to now. What is the chips to become that much more powerful. When you were making chips people weren't really talking about hardware that much. It was really the time that software web companies all of these were in this spotlight. But today everyone seems to be back talking about chips which is why you spent so What we're saying is that for a long time software developers could do incredible things and just assume that the hardware would be good enough to sort of run everything. They wouldn't have to necessarily make their code more efficient or be limited by that. And in the background you and your fellow chip makers were just marching on making things even better all the time without any notice whatsoever. Whereas now because we're coming up to the limits of the hardware people are having to think much more creatively essentially. But let's put some numbers on some of the things we've been talking about. How much have chips improved in the past few decades then? Shilash can you put this into a perspective for me? How much of a challenge is energy consumption really? As demand for chips continues to so. So energy consumption is a very big challenge That's incredible. That's a crazy amount of energy. It seems very inefficient. So I guess one of the hurdles in the hardware now is to make these things more efficient. So what kinds of techniques are being used to make chips more efficient? to the transistor. I mean that sounds like a very simple change. I imagine it's more complicated challenge. What are the technological challenges are on the cards to be solved to make these chips So Shilash it can't be easy to stack chips in 3D. Otherwise imagine people would have done it that exist between them. Without destroying the stuff you've built already. Exactly and so that to me. Silicon has been the workhorse as you say of the digital revolution because well first of all there's so much of it on earth we've got almost infinite supply but also we've built our entire sort of manufacturing industry around it to make these chips and they're made in the most exquisite manner. So what other materials might be useful and if it's not silicon that could make chips in the volume that we know that's needed. There are two classes of materials that are looking So things like graphene. Graphene is a two-dimensional material. It's a sort of a lattice of carbon atoms and a carbon nanotube is basically a rolled up sheet of graphene as far as I can gather. So these are the sorts of things that we could use to make completely new types of semiconductors. But who's working on this and what kinds of things would we need to do to turn them into useful design and structure of computer chips. The architecture in other words, you mentioned earlier that it's the AI boom that's making chips more important again. That's why people are talking about them and want to really push past the limits. How did deep learning systems, the type that power things like chat GPT in modern machine learning, how do they use chips in a way that's different to Shalesh, that's super interesting. Dave there was talking about how domain-specific chips have become popular in the modern age of AI. So Google, for example, realized that without faster and cheaper chips in their data centers, their ability to run AI applications would be constrained. And so therefore, AI is driving a revolution in chip architecture. They've also talked about those data centers and the chips required for training those AI models. But what are the computational making their own domain specific chips. And that's quite an important shift then. That's true. that they run. I mean, how much difference do you think that the gains in different architectures will make? Is there a role for the algorithms to improve as well? I mean, they must be. speed of computing. In that case, you're just reducing the number of digits that are being stored in each bit of the network. So, essentially less memory. That's exactly right. Now, the trick is to Exactly. And before we move on, I just want to repeat, you got a sense from Dave Patterson on what the future looks like. I mean, as one of the people who is leading the field of computer architecture, what does he think about the excitement that's swirling around about the innovation problems. This is a great time for researchers. So chip makers have been getting more imaginative with their designs. But what does all that innovation mean for some of the biggest users of those new chips? The people and companies actually developing artificial intelligence. For the final part of today's episode, joining Shilesh and me here in studio is Ratchnashanbog. Our business fairs editor who wrote our leader last week on the technology challenges facing generative AI. Thanks for joining us Ratchnash. Thanks, I look for having me on your award-winning podcast. Thank you very much, Ratchnash. Now, your reporting this week looked at the geopolitics of all of this. Chips are right at the centre of international trade and politics now. Is industrial policy affecting how chips are being invaded? So chipmaking is definitely a geopolitical because most Chinese researchers can't get hold of the most cutting edge and video chips, they're having to design algorithms that work more efficiently. What are some of the interesting the companies are innovating. It's interesting that those innovations have come through because of the limits that the Chinese researchers have when it comes to technology, but I can imagine those things being used, even if you've got the technology to run even bigger large language models, I mean, they're a mixture of experts or a small language model, these could be useful everywhere. Because this is the only way through at least the next few years. Absolutely. Now, now you went to the belly of the beast recently, actually two Nvidia's offices in California, to see the people who are driving the hardware that's critical for AI. Just tell them what it's like there. Did you see the future? office. They weren't like designs posted on the walls. Not that I could see. It's been with families, he's never seen without it. Well, the leather jacket is the uniform of the future. I'm just going to keep saying that. That's interesting. What's fascinating from what you just said there was that actually Nvidia, which is a hardware maker, is thinking all about these applications that, you know, hardware manufacturers, I'm sure, Shilash, when you were designing computer chips, you weren't thinking about all the applications. You were thinking how can I make this chip much, much smaller and more powerful. I suppose it means that they're creating a market for their product. Although I suppose Nvidia doesn't really need to do that anymore. It has a massive market already. Shilash, do you have any sense of how widely used Nvidia chips are? EITs. Hence their valuation as a company. Exactly. Now the story that you, Ratchner and our colleague, Henry Tricks put together, he's our US technology editor. The stories that you put together were looking into the race that's now on to push artificial intelligence beyond its technical limits. How much of a role will chips play into that goal? are that you think AI needs now that the hardware seems to be the limitation. intensive. I mean, on the surface, this could be seen as a slightly negative or kind of worrying story for this massive new industry that everyone's very excited about. And people might be down about it, but when you went to Nvidia and you also went to meet people at OpenAI, were they still optimistic about all of this? I mean, I guess they have to be because that's it. Do you know the idea that actually we don't know who the winners are going to be is actually quite exciting? Let's bring this programme to an end by talking about chips again. What does the future Shaleesh Rachina, thank you very much both for your time. Thank you, Yolo. Thank you. Our thanks also to Eric Pop, Dave Patterson and Mark Assink of ASML. And thank you for listening. You can dive much deeper into the future of chip making by reading all seven chapters of Shaleesh's TQ on the Economist app. It's full of fascinating details and diagrams to explain this hugely complicated but exciting story.

These days a journalist from Belarus writing about Belarus is overwhelmingly unlikely to be in Belarus. Relentless, violent repression in the country is the norm. Our correspondent reports from a conference for exiles where photos were forbidden. Sarah Lawneuk is a senior producer for the intelligence. So it must be striking to have that happen at a journalism conference. There were sort of restrictions on the journalism being done. Did you speak to people about why that protection of identity was such a big deal? Well, maybe before we go on here, let's wind back. Tell me why it is all of these journalists are in exile. And so the journalists who met that are hosting this conference, many of them are trying to stay if you like in the shadows. What is it like for them working in those shadows? Presumably some of them in the room or no? So they think they're getting enough of the news into Belarus to justify the real risks that they're all taking. Sarah thanks very much for joining us. Okay so this is maybe the largest number of people I have seen in the studio certainly the largest number of feet because it's four people and a dog. First of all who are we here with everybody Jason Chow I write for it for a desk Rosie we know hi Rosie. Hi I'm J. How from the drum tower team and the dog is our spirit animal very good Jason why is it we're here there's two decks of cards have been shuffled and now dealt out I have a giant stack I'm supposed to keep track of what are we doing. Okay my turn. So if each province though has its own kind of homegrown game do we have a good sense for why this is the one that went national? Laying flat culture meaning the sort of reluctance to put in too many hours. We need to do this again at a more sociable hour for playing the game with beer. With beer with beer. Meet you back here just after lunch. The Economist Hello and welcome to the Intelligence. From the Economist, I'm your host, Jason Palmer. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. The word woke is an evocative one, especially as a major battle line in American politics. The key point is to define it. When we do and then crunch some data, we find that the country seems to have passed peak woke. And it is a huge date in the global calendar of football, not the real kind, the video game kind. It's time for the latest update of the world-beating game that for decades was simply called FIFA. We ask why it's not anymore. First up though. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is once again doing the rounds in America. Later today, have Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Yesterday he was in Washington meeting with supporters, vice president Kamala Harris After a handful of trips to the U.S. since the war began, it's all a bit familiar. But this trip may matter more than others, because who wins the White House in November will determine how much support Ukraine will get in the future and in turn, perhaps, how the war in Ukraine ends. Daniel Franklin is our senior U.S. editor. For this visit, there was much talk of a peace plan. The Mr. Zelensky was going to present. What is in it? What's the ask at this point? But what does Mr. Zelensky think the West can do to turn that around? In a sense, that sounds as if it's the same scope of ask that it has been every time that Mr. Zelensky has turned towards the West what's different this time. How is that playing into this politically in what is ultimately the end of a presidential campaign? When you say doing it, you mean a peace agreement that wouldn't look good to Ukrainian eyes? But given those diplomatic troubles and uncertainties and the sketchy situation on the battlefield, as you say, do you think that Ukraine's ambitions, Mr. Zelensky's ambitions are changing? You mentioned that Ukraine's fate is obviously tied to the political situation in Washington, but what about the political situation at home for him? Daniel, thanks very much for joining us. Part of what's setting the tone for international diplomacy is what Ukraine is willing to accept diplomatically, which ties into what it's being forced to accept militarily. Let me direct your attention to tomorrow's episode of the weekend intelligence. Our editor-in-chief, Zany Minton Betos, recently traveled to Ukraine, meeting soldiers and civilians near the front lines to understand what Ukrainians actually want to end a half John Prado is our United States editor and a host of Czechs and Balanced, our show about American politics. Now John, before we get into this, you know I'm a man who believes in definitions first and foremost. What's your definition of woke? And to your minds, how much of this wokeness as defined then is consuming America at the moment? And so talk me through the trend line here though, you said that this began to take a turn upwards in 2016 peaked in 2020 issue. So what made you through the timing? And so what do you think is going on there? It's easy to imagine the timeline you describe here being purely political. Trump in power or threatening to be in power. Wilkness is high on the rise once that fades away. It sounds like a political phenomenon. Well is it though? I mean the other end of a trend line like that is we get back to a place where these things are not seen with clear eyes. These things are not discussed. People don't consider these issues at all. Now this sounds like a rich vein for a certain American politics podcast I know tell me. Dom Wayne Wright is the economist's tech and media editor. EA Sports, to the game. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence. The show's editors are Chris Impey and Jack Gill. Our deputy editor is John Jo Devlin and our sound designer is Will Ro with help this week from Alex Port Felix. Our senior producers are Rory Galloway and Sarah Larnuk and our senior creative producer is William Warren. Our producers are Maggie Kitefa and Benji Guy and our assistant producer is Henrietta McFarlane with extra production help this week from Peter Grannitz and Jonathan Day. We'll all see you back here tomorrow for The Weekend Intelligence. The Economist And I'm Jason Palmer. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. And imagine a diner, well dressed, wearing cologne, fully moisturized, eating a low fat chicken dish with peas, lentils and a whiff of sage. Now imagine that it's a dog. We dive into the seemingly bottomless market for luxury bad care. Avantika Chalcoati is the economist's global business correspondent. And to the tune of what kind of cost are we talking about here, keeping one's dog moisturized? But why not? If people won't spend it on themselves, why are they spending more on the pets? Why is that? What's the generational divide there? And presumably, the companies that provide all the stuff, the gifts and the foods and the moisturizers and so on are, and I choose my words carefully here, lapping it up. And we were going to need a pet's related regulator just to handle all of this. I mean, as far as what people will do for their pets, spend on their pets after this chat, I'm wondering what's the limit? What next? OK, you have provided me with a link here. And I have clicked through to something called Vista Pet, which, quote, ensures that loyal companions receive the same excellent support as their owners. There's a picture of a dog climbing up the little stairs to what is clearly a private jet. There's an in-flight amenity kit, two toys, the spray bottle full of something no doubt soothing. Safe and soft cabin is advertised. I mean, I basically want to be a pet more than I want to be a human at this point. I want to get thank you very much for joining us. Don't you think you want to get a pet or does it now sound too expensive? That's an economist way of thinking about it. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence. We'll see you back here tomorrow. The Economist On yesterday's show, we took a look at Volodymyr Zelensky's trip to America. How the Ukrainian President with a plan for victory in his pocket is shoring up support at the UN and among America's presidential contenders. This is the picture that much of the world gets. Mr. Zelensky is avatar of Ukraine's people, their resolve, their unity of purpose. From the ground, it is far, far more complicated. So we're going to take you there. I'm Jason Palmer and this is the weekend intelligence. Our editor-in-chief is Enniment and Betos travels to Ukraine, meeting generals, soldiers and civilians near the front lines to get a real gauge of the answer to a question that Mr. Zelensky is not posing. It's kind of an end to this war is good enough. This episode of the Weekend Intelligence was presented by Zanimintin Beadows and produced by Heidi Pet, with reporting from Oliver Carroll, our Kauri Ostrovsky, Mark Tararionova, and Anastasia Parfonyuk, sound engineering by Carla Patela and Alex Port Felix. The executive producer of the Weekend Intelligence is Jimi Nubi. If you want to hear more about Ukraine, join our live event on October 25th, with its forces under pressure, winter approaching, and the future of American support uncertain, our editors will be discussing crunch time for Ukraine.

It wasn't all that long after Britain's vote to leave the European Union that pulls flipped. By now, lots of people, particularly in the Labour Party, reckon it was a terrible idea. So now that it's in power, why can't Labour do anything about it? There are a whole bunch of reasons why Britain's leave voters have gone cold on Brexit. You might argue that the claims of the pro-Brexit camp were always bound to be disappointing. More concretely, you might point to Britain's relative economic underperformance, since leaving the market that it shared with its largest trading partner. The much touted tighter control on immigration, well that hasn't shown up in the migration figures. If anything, many people miss a certain kind of migrant. Or you might note that in the end the divorce was chaotic. It's been an unmitigated disaster. Absolute disaster. Brexit was a hobby horse of and then a project by and then you might argue an albatross for the Conservative Party. So now that they're out of power, does anything change? Matthew Holhaus is our British political correspondent. OK, so eight years later, now it is a Labour government. What is the government's position on Brexit? So what to read into that, the sort of fence mending tour on the part of Mr. Stormer? But doesn't that create some tension? You were saying that something like three quarters of Labour voters would vote to rejoin. Nearly that fraction wants another referendum here. Why aren't those voters putting more pressure on Labour? And perhaps that is because the government is relatively new. I mean how do you see these forces changing over the course of the government? I mean hearing all that you might guess that what's going on here is that that political will widespread now among Britain's to do something more about the relationship of the EU is going to find a way, whether it's in the Labour Party or not. Matthew, thanks very much for joining us. Amelia Wood writes for the economist. So why would that happen? Surely getting Michelin star is a way to get more people in the doors to make the business more successful. In the sensitive people are going out for those special occasions, those occasions have to be really special. It seems a weird relation. Is it limited to restaurants, this dynamic where having success means well risking future failure? So as regards to the restaurant industry, then does that mean restaurant owners, maybe even chefs, might kind of hope to not get a Michelin star if they know that this is the relationship that's going on? Amelia, thanks very much for your time. The Economist Hello and welcome to the Intelligence from The Economist. I'm your host Jason Ballmer. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. America's presidential election will once again be decided by voters in just a handful of states. In the first installment of our swing state series, we take a look at one of them and a wild race for governor that will influence the state's vote for president. And a year ago we launched our audio subscription, Economist Podcasts Plus. You'll remember how many times I reminded you to sign up. We look back over a year's worth of the world broadening journalism that my colleagues have done since then. But first... At the UN last night, calls for calm amidst a growing crisis. Now a week ago, we spoke with you about the exploding pages and walkie-talkies across Lebanon. What has changed since then? How did we get to where we are today? And while all of these strikes have been going on, how has it been for civilians on the ground? What's it like for the Lebanese at this moment who are not the intended targets allegedly? And what do you make of the hint that the next stage in this might be actual Israeli boots on the ground? And what about the international angle on this who might be able to sort of reduce the tensions in some way? And so given all of that, what's the best we can hope for here? Thanks very much for the update Greg. Thank you. I don't know if you've heard but there is a big election coming up in America. It's already been a wild ride with one candidate dropping out and being replaced and another who's been subject to two assassination attempts. In less than 40 days something like 150 million Americans will have voted for a new president and to replace about a third of senators and every member of the House of Representatives. But as we keep pointing out America has an unusual electoral system. Only a tiny fraction of those voters in a handful of swing states will actually decide the presidential race. So over the next six weeks we're going to be looking at those states and what it is that exercises the voters though. We're starting in a place that wasn't really thought of as a swing state until a few weeks ago. Rebecca Jackson writes about the American South for the economist and this week is coming to us from North Carolina. So just give us kind of a picture then of North Carolina from an electoral map point of view. Why does it vote the way that it does? And there's some chance though that that might happen this time around. Now, I think I've heard about this on the news, but talk me through it. So what does all that though mean for the wider race, the presidential race? And what do you make of that bet? Is that going to work? Thanks very much for your time, Rebecca. It has been a whole year since we launched economist podcasts Plus.

And there's a card game in China called Guangdang, which so rumour has it is popular among some communist party leaders. But it's also controversial. We felt duty-bound to turn our studio into a gambling den, temporarily at least. But first... One by one, Israel is decapitating enemy organisations. This weekend an Israeli air strike on Beirut killed Hasan Nazrallah, head of his bolla, a militant group which operates from Lebanon and is backed by Iran. Nazrallah, he said, was not just another terrorist, he was THE terrorist. Israel claimed a further 20-hzbollah leaders died in the same raid. It also struck sites in Yemen, a response to drones launch from there by Iran-backed hootie militants. This escalation comes two months after the assassination in Iran of Ismail Haneer, the head of Hamas, which staged the attacks on Israel on October the 7th last year. The action is now braced to see how his bolla and Iran may respond to the weekend's events. But Israel's new offensive has affected a far wider group of people than just the militants it claimed to target. And so will the implications. Whatever happens now, Israel seems determined to reshape Lebanon and the Middle East. I'm joined by Andrew Feffer, our Israel correspondent, and Gareth Brown, our correspondent in Beirut. Gareth, what's the situation where you are this morning? What has the reaction been from Hasen, and what do they have the capacity to do in response now? And Anshel, turning to you, of course, we've seen Israel's actions. What has it said about its intentions now? And of course, this isn't the only thing that Israel has done over the weekend. It's also widened its offensive into Yemen targeting Houthi militia. And of course, world leaders, including Biden, have been calling on Netanyahu to hold back, and he seems to have done precisely the opposite. What can we expect from him next? And what's the end game for Israel, do you think? It's obviously a particularly tense time with the anniversary of the October 7th attacks coming up and Rosha Shonah. Any sense of any response from Iran? Gareth, Angela, thank you so much for talking to me. Why is it cool throwing eggs? I just a mess with you sounds a little bit like China. Yes just slightly messes with your head even though it's super cool. It's time for someone to lay a card. I played I played the six of clubs so you won six. That's a bomb. That's a tube. No it's not a bomb but it's a scrambled egg. She threw a bomb. Who knew throwing a bomb was so fun? Who was it who came up with this game do we know? When I was in Beijing about ten years ago the big game was Beat the Landlords. Which people used to play in Ritambark and they weren't supposed to be playing games because they were gambling on it. And so they would bring cushions to sit on and they would bring a bath mat to play the game on and then they'd sort of play along the wall. And then they could quickly whisk off if they thought they were going to be someone that spotted them gambling. Are people still playing that? So we've hit the jackpot here we are getting to play games at work without laying flat. Nice one thank you thank you Jason. Maybe we just have lunch and then have another round. And I'll have another round. Yeah, no, I'll book the studio. Some Chinese Communist Party pastimes are fairly harmless. Others such as detaining foreigners at will are quite the opposite. This week on Drum Tower our China podcast you can hear the second of our two part interview with Michael Covreg. A Canadian former diplomat who was imprisoned for almost three years in China. The first part went out last week and the second as tomorrow. It's an incredible story. As ever you'll need to be a subscriber to listen. That's it for this episode of the Intelligence. Do let us know what you think of the show. You can get in touch at podcastataconemys.com. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Hello and welcome to the Intelligence from the Economist. I'm your host Rosie Bloor. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. Remember those nuclear arms agreements that limited the number of warheads to keep us safe? Well, they're actually about to expire. If you think things are grim now, they could get even grimmer. And are you tired of all the data and polls and objective measures of political fortunes? Good news. Our correspondent looks at an alternative type of forecasting that's proving surprisingly popular. We meet the political astrologers. But first. These days we hear about AI all the time. It's apparently transforming every aspect of our lives. And in that revolution, one company is vastly ahead of the pack. Even AI is the firm behind ChatGPT and it could soon become a very rare beast indeed. Not just a Silicon Valley unicorn, but a Hektakorn. That's the term for a start-up valued at over $100 billion. Until now Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX was the only American start-up to reach that level. But open AI may soon be valued at $150 billion. The problem is that when you get to that size and need to raise money, you really do need funders to chip in very large sums. And that means most of the usual investors just aren't big enough. Henry Tricks is our US tech editor. So Henry, how is open AI different from previous start-ups? Henry, does it really matter if VCs aren't taking part? Does it matter if they're being pushed out by their big arrivals? And you say they're making big bets. How much money are we talking about here? How much does it cost to set up and run these AI models? So the assumption in what you're saying, Henry, then is the more money you put in, the better it gets, the better AI keeps getting. Is that right? And where does all that creativity leave open AI, which is so dominant at the moment? Henry, great to talk to you. For military planners at the Pentagon, the ultimate aim is to be prepared for every threat so that they don't have to confront any of them. That task is getting a lot harder. For decades, nuclear strategy has been about keeping the size of arsenals in check. Now alliances are more complex than they were in the past and more fluid. So for the first time since the Cold War, American strategists are questioning the current nuclear order. Anton La Guardia is our diplomatic editor. So just explain what exactly is the new threat. You've laid out such a terrifying threat of nuclear armageddon, I'm not quite sure where to go from there but what happened to the treaties that were supposed to keep the stockpile of nuclear weapons relatively contained. So how is the US proposing to resolve this? Are we heading into a second Cold War Anton? Anton, thank you. It's fascinating and terrifying to talk to you. Holly Berman is a news editor at the Economist. This year, more than half the world's population has already or will cast their votes in over 70 elections worldwide. Tomorrow, our editor and chief San Ementan Beddos will be live in New York to discuss these elections and their impact on democracy.

Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. Ukraine's president has spent months asking his country's allies to supply long-range missiles. But what difference would these weapons actually make in the war with Russia? And we've had biopics of historical figures, Hollywood icons and pop stars. The latest trend is designers. Why are correspondent asks is showing fashionistas on screen now so well fashionable? First up though. Markets and pundits had been anticipating the move for weeks. And yesterday Jerome Powell, chair of America Central Bank the Federal Reserve, revealed the decision. The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to between 4.75 and 5%. It's the first cut since the pandemic when rates were slashed. Since then they've been on an upward path to combat raging inflation. This latest move suggests the Fed thinks it has tamed inflation without plunging America into recession, achieving the soft landing that everyone wants. But it could also indicate worries about a different part of America's economy. Simon Arabinovich is our US economic seditor. Simon, we've been waiting for a cut for a really long time. Did you know this was coming? Did we see this coming? So what does this cut say about how America's economy is doing? And how will the Fed's rate cuts help keep the American economy strong? And there was one dissenting voice, as I understand it, in that decision. How important is that? So do you think we'll see more interest rate cuts? And when would we see these? Simon, I'm delighted you reminded me that it's an election year. How might this decision to cut rates affect either presidential campaign? Simon, thank you so much for talking to me. And if you want to hear more about the election, and let's face it, who doesn't? We've made our US politics show checks and balance, free to all listeners until October 6th. Every Friday, John Prado and his co-host take on one big theme in American politics. Tomorrow, could Trump contest the election result? Shashank Joshi is the economist defense editor. So Shashank, can you lay out this intense public debate for me? What are the arguments here? So who's right, Shashank? What do you think? So Shashank just explained to me exactly what missiles we're talking about here then. And why does America have a substantial say on European missiles? So if the ultimate decision about whether these missiles can be provided both the hardware and the software comes down to the US, do you think that American concerns about escalation can be overcome? Shashank, there's a clock on this with winter coming, Ukraine in a tight spot and the presidential election. When are we going to get any kind of result? Shashank, thank you very much. Out with a boom. Rachel Lloyd is our deputy culture editor. How do you say it? The roads of the ladies are not as corruptable as life. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence.

I'm your host Rosie Bloor. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. Japan's new Prime Minister loves trains, planes and ramen. Unfortunately he doesn't love many of his fellow party members, or rather they don't love him. Our correspondent weighs his prospects. And our work columnist laments one of the worst inventions of modern office life when your manager invites the team to a sandwich lunch. But first... In the past two weeks one question has come up again and again. Will the conflict on Israel's northern border escalate into an invasion? Today we have an answer. The moment Israel launching a ground operation in Lebanon, the moment we're in Greece. Israel says its ground operation is limited, localized and targeted. Meanwhile, air strikes continued overnight in Beirut's southern suburbs. Thousands of people have already been displaced, and Israeli missiles have also hit Syria's capital Damascus. The international community is now clamoring for calm. But for the moment that is not on the Israeli government's agenda. Greg Karlstrom is our Middle East correspondent. And as you say, they're saying it's a small ground offensive. What's the actual stated purpose of it? And how has Hezbollah responding so far? We've also heard about air strikes on Damascus overnight. What do we know about those? And how have the US and its allies responded to this escalation? And Greg, as you say, no one wants this to become a large-scale invasion, but we have no idea if Israel has an exit plan. How likely is it to become a war with Lebanon? Greg, thank you so much for talking to me. My pleasure. Today, Ashiba Shigeru was sworn in as Japan's Prime Minister. It was his fifth bid to lead Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party in an unusually competitive contest. This time around nine candidates fought for the top spot, the highest number in 50 years. And Ashiba's victory was unexpected. Though he's promised to be a leader who speaks truth with courage and sincerity, he has few solid allies within the party. In recent years, many of Japan's Prime Ministers have lasted only a short time in office. So how will Ashiba Shigeru do? Noah Snyder is our East Asia bureau chief. So what can we expect from Ashiba? And what about within the LDP? Where are the fault lines in Japanese politics? What are the stakes here of his leadership? Now, what does all that translate into in terms of his priorities as a leader? And what does that mean in practical terms? No, thank you so much. Great to talk to you.

Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. Many countries are putting up barriers to electric cars imported from China. Britain by contrast is welcoming the cheap vehicles. We find out why. And Emily in Paris? Well, let's just say it divides people. But many French viewers who started out hating the TV series now seem to think that in the words of Emily herself, it's Tresbon. But first, Naginta did write about Afghanistan. Naginta, we've long heard that the Taliban is hostile to women to use an understatement. Why have things got worse recently? What specifically knew in these laws? Wow, that's shocking to think you could be arrested for looking at someone. What are the women you've spoken to saying about this? One of the things that was talked about when the Taliban came back into power three years ago was a question of how much they would actually enforce restrictions on women. And I'm wondering how much we know about that at this point. And again, among those restrictions, a bloc on women working, what's all that doing to the economy? Were you able to speak with any women who are still working? May fair in London is a haven for car spotters. On just a short walk, you'll see and hear countless examples of luxury vehicles cruising the streets. And nestled in amongst the fancy shops are car showrooms for iconic brands from Britain, Germany and Italy. Rolls Royce has been there since 1932. But now across the street, a newcomer has arrived. Archie Hall is our Britain economics correspondent. And why is that happening? So how are these being marketed to the British driver? We've heard talk about electric vehicles from China going all over the world and partly because they're cheap. So what's different about what's happening in Britain? So elsewhere are the concerns about geopolitics or simply trade? Is there any concern in Britain about any of these worries that a vexing government elsewhere? Have you tried one of these EVs? Oh, gee, thank you so much. Sophie Peta is our Paris bureau chief. Sophie, are you a fan? So none of those stereotypes has really changed. Why are the French now lapping it up? But Emily's French is just as awful as ever, as I remember it. Surely it takes a bit more than using their own language to engage the French audience, And so, Sophie, we've been talking a lot recently about the beauty of Paris, rather enjoyable. The Olympics, of course, was last month. And many Parisians dreaded it, and then when it came about, actually, we're really delighted to see how well the games went and delighted to see Paris looking so good on their screens. Is Emily part of that, do you think? I suppose one of the things about Emily and Paris is that it hasn't really got any better, but the world has got a lot worse since then. And so it's almost like we need some kind of slightly vacuous drama to enjoy in the meantime. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence. Do let us know what you think of the show. You can get in touch at podcastadoconomist.com. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Hello and welcome to the Intelligence from The Economist. I'm your host Rosie Bloor. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. We all know that Americans love big cars, but aside from being pricey and polluting, there's another problem with them. Large vehicles are far more deadly than small ones. And many of us never quite grow out of our childhood fascination with dinosaurs. No wonder then that when our correspondent went fossil hunting on Britain's Jurassic Coast, she found she was far from alone. First up though. It began yesterday with a series of explosions. In one video, a man shopping in a bay route market is thrown to the ground when it seems his hip explodes. In another, someone is standing at a cash register and the same thing happens. Similar scenes played out across Lebanon and Syria as thousands of pages exploded within an hour of each other. These low-tech devices had been used by Hezbollah, the sheer militant group, to communicate by text and try to evade Israeli surveillance. But that strategy has now backfired literally. Greg Colstrom is our Middle East correspondent. Greg, this is the most extraordinary attack. I mean, it's like nothing that we've seen before. What do we know about who's responsible? Greg, how might they have pulled this off? And assuming it was Israel, why do this and why do this now? And what will the impact be for Hezbollah? And of course an attack on the country as a whole is a huge escalation of what had been a kind of lower level skirmish between his Bola and Israel for a long time. What comes next, you think? Greg, thank you very much for talking to us this morning. The saying goes that everything is bigger in Texas, but in the world of motor vehicles, the lone star state is by no means alone. In fact, it's no secret that Americans in general love big cars. While Europe is famous for its narrow streets and nippy run-arounds, in the US you see suburban mums driving trucks designed to haul farm animals. But size isn't everything. Big cars tend to guzzle fuel, which is expensive for the driver and for the planet. And there's another often hidden problem with heavy vehicles. Duck Dousen is a data journalist at the Economist. So you've been analyzing the numbers. What do they actually show? So that's pretty astonishing data. Why is the US still allowing these vehicles on the road? And is that why Americans love big cars because they feel they're safer? It's extraordinary stuff. Doug, what can be done then to make America's road safer? So if we're not going to get lighter cars, what else can be done to improve the safety of American roads? Doug, thank you so much for talking to me. Katie Bryant is a senior video producer. Hunting for fossils isn't the only reason to go out and enjoy the landscape. This week on Babbage, our science podcast, Professor Kathy Willis explains the health benefits of spending time in nature. The show goes out today and you'll need to be a subscriber to listen. That's it for this episode of The Intelligence. Do send us any thoughts you can get in touch at podcastatacornomice.com. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Hello and welcome to the Intelligence from The Economist. I'm your host Rosie Blore. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. We all know that the planet is getting hotter and hotter. But what does this mean for elite athletes competing at the peak of physical fitness? High level sport is getting harder and deadlier. And it was a chance observation that changed the path of Francisco Lopera, a Colombian doctor who spent his life investigating the genetic markers of Alzheimer's disease. Our obituries editor remembers him. But first... Anshul Fefer is our Israel correspondent. Antelon Tuesday, there were thousands of pages exploding across Lebanon on Wednesday, walkie-talkies. And at the time we asked, was this the attack or was it the precursor to a bigger thing? It now seems pretty clear that this was the precursor to something much bigger. Is that right? So what does hisbola said about this? How strong actually is hisbola then? So what might we expect to see in the coming days? And as you say it's escalating quickly, is there any prospect that it might de-escalate? And shall thank you so much, maybe one day speak on happier occasions. It's always incredible to watch athletes at the top of their game. And we've had a bumper year of sport with the Euros and the Olympics. But these days athletes aren't just competing against each other. They're also battling with rising temperatures. At the US Open earlier this month it hit 35 degrees. That proved too much for Sam. Last year, Skysport captured the moment Daniel Medvedev, one of the top seats, questioned how players were going to cope on such scorching courts. I cannot imagine. One player are going to die and they're going to see her. Rachel Dobs is an environment editor at the Economist. So what difference can heat actually make to the performance of elite athletes? So Rachel, we've all had the experience of being outside in the heat and finding it hard to exert ourselves. But tell me what actually happens in the body when it's very hot. You mentioned that there can be adjustments made such as holding marathons at night and things. But what else can be done to mitigate the effects of a heating climate for the athletes? Sport is obviously huge business these days. Is there a risk that athletes are going to be pushed beyond what's safe because the financial stakes of canceling or postponing a tournament is so high? Rachel, thank you so much. Great to talk to you. Thanks for having me, Rosie. Anro is the economist of Bittre's editor. Anne Rowe on Francisco Lopera who has died age 73.

We'll all see you back here for the weekend intelligence tomorrow. Hello and welcome to the intelligence from the economist. I'm Rosie Blore. The resisting for decades the Chinese government has finally raised the retirement age. But an attempt to solve one problem, the pension crisis, may have some surprising consequences in another part of Chinese society. Kamala Harris' campaign for the White House has attracted some surprising support. Recently former vice president Dick Cheney announced he would be voting for Harris in November. His daughter Liz Cheney once one of the most powerful Republicans in the House told an event at Duke University that she would be too. An a handful of Republicans even endorsed Harris on stage at the Democratic National Convention. But though these high level Republicans say they'll never vote for Donald Trump, the party faithful seem unwilling to follow them. Rebecca Jackson is our southern correspondent. So Becca, can you just explain to me what is a never-trump? Can these never Trump has made any difference in the election and particularly in the swing states where they would matter most? So what are they actually trying to achieve? Are they trying to persuade people not to vote for Trump or are they actually calling for people to vote for Harris? And is he right? Is it a movement of leaders without followers? Becca, thank you so much for talking to me. Thanks for having me. Jason Chao writes about foreign affairs for the economist. So explain to me the link Jason between retirement age and childcare in China. So if grandparents are looking after kids, the concern is that raising the retirement age means that couples may have children later or even not at all, right? Seeing grandparents with tiny grandkids is a staple of life in China as our villages populated only by the young and the old with working-age people leaving. But why can't people in China pay for child care like they do everywhere else? You've said that the Chinese government wants to increase fertility. So is there any sense it will make any moves on child care costs? So how does all this feed into growing anxieties about slowing growth in China's economy? Jason, thanks very much. Good to talk to you. To hear about a very different side to life in China, do check out today's episode of Drum Tower, our weekly podcast on China. David Rene is interviewing Michael Coverick, who was incarcerated in China for nearly three years until 2021, an extraordinary tale of hostage diplomacy. Over two episodes for the first time, Michael tells his own story of the experience. And I'm Rosie Blore. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. And for many of us the term grandmaster evokes the image of a middle-aged man's dupt over a chess board. Well, we got the chess board bit right, but more and more people are reaching the pinnacle of the game while they're still children. But first. And what have you seen on the ground, Gareth? Gareth, you've been to Beirut, southern suburbs. Tell me how you managed that and what you saw. Gareth, what do we know about how strong his Ballet is more generally? Obviously, it's just over two weeks since the Pager attacks. Asrallah was killed a week ago, now the ground incursion. How much are his Ballet weakened? Gareth, as you say, Israel has decided to go into his Ballet's playground and that that's incredibly dangerous for them. Are you suggesting that this war might not go as Israel hopes it will, that it won't be able to neutralize his Ballet? So, bring words, Gareth. Thank you for talking to us. On Monday, it will be one year since Hamas attacked Israel on October the 7th. We'll be dedicating the whole show to the Middle East, looking at how the region has been changed and what may lie ahead. And there'll also be a chance to listen again to our recent episode of The Weekend Intelligence, in which our editor-in-chief, Sunny Minton Betos, went to Gaza to ask, what happens when the conflict's over? You'll find the show in our feed. Vishnu Patmanaban is our Asia correspondent. So why are we seeing so many young Grandmasters? Do pushy parents play a role, do you think? So how do you train to be a grandmaster? Are the younger grandmasters actually edging the older ones out of the market? Fish knew, thank you. Great to talk to you. On tomorrow's weekend intelligence will be telling the story of Michael Covrig, a former Canadian diplomat who spent more than a thousand days imprisoned in China. He was subject to persistent interrogation and was kept in a padded cell with the lights always on. In a system he says, designed to crush the human spirit. The first of his extraordinary two-part interview will be free to listen. Until then, that's it for this episode of The Intelligence. The show's editors are Chris Impey and Jack Gill. Our deputy editor is John Jo Devlin and our sound designer is Will Roe, with help this week from Timo Salah. Our senior producers are Rory Galloway and Sarah Larnic. Our senior creator producer is William Warren. Our producers are Maggie Kadifah and Benji Guy and our assistant producer is Henrietta McFarlane, with extra production help this week from Peter Granite, Jonathan Day and Emily Elias. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Nine months into the war, the devastation brought by the Israeli military in Gaza is extreme, and the human suffering greater still. Even as the bombs keep falling, torque has turned to the day after. But most of the time, this torque is actually about the years after. Political solutions, the possibility of a Palestinian state. But before that, has to come the rebuilding. Relief and reconstruction will be crucial, clearing unexploded ordnance, fixing the sewage system and working at how to feed two million people properly, not to mention rebuilding homes, hospitals and schools. But the brutal reality is that you can't hope to get going on any of that effectively, without security and someone in charge. People who know this region, who've worked there for years, are warning that without a credible plan for immediate security, post-Tisfire Gaza may turn into what they're calling Mocha Dischu on the Med. A lawless zone run by armed gangs. There's a risk of a complete breakdown of society. This is the weekend intelligence. On this episode, who's making that plan? And is it credible? The economist's editor-in-chief, Sunny Minton Beddows, traveled to Israel and Palestine in late June. A company by our Israel correspondent, Anshel Fethan. And our Middle East correspondent, Greg Carlström. Thanks for listening to this episode of The Weekend Intelligence, which was presented by Zany Mint and Bedo's, with reporting from Greg Kahlstrom and Shilfeffa, Garith Brown, Nicholas Palum and Heidi Pet. The producer was Heidi Pet. Fact checking was by Charlotte Mons with sound designed by Nicholas Rofast. The executive producer of The Weekend Intelligence is Jemma Nubi. Hello and welcome to the intelligence from the economist. I'm Rosie Bloor. And a Michelin star is the most coveted award a restaurant owner can earn. And usually wins them a flood of new customers. And as our correspondent finds out, that delicious success can be hard to sustain. Last night, James Bennett, our Lexington columnist, watched the first and only Vice Presidential debate. When JD Vance, the Republican running mate to Donald Trump, vied with Tim Waltz, who's Kamala Harris' pick as potential Democrat VP. James, before we get to that jolt of reality late in the debate, tell me what each candidate wanted to accomplish last night. So let's take JD Vance first. What did he need to show viewers? And how about Tim Waltz? What message did he want to get across? But James, you mentioned earlier the moment when the debate turned and Tim Walls did manage to call JD Vance on one of his outlandish claims on election denialism. Step me through that. Fascinating stuff. So what would your assessment be? What do you think this debate means for the election overall? And do vice presidential debate performances have an effect on who wins the presidency? Thank you so much James. That's it for this episode of The Intelligence.

Hello and welcome to the Intelligence from The Economist. I'm your host Rosie Blore. Today we're devoting the whole episode to an event that has shaped the past 12 months. A year ago today, thousands of members of Hamas, a militant Palestinian group based in Gaza, burst through barriers into Israel. They massacred more than 1,100 people and took a further 250 hostage. Since then, Israel has fought non-stop with Hamas in Gaza. Nearly 2 million people there have been displaced and much of the territory has been reduced to rubble. Israel has exchanged rockets with Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. A week ago, it sent troops across the border into Lebanon to battle hisbola, a Lebanese militia. The next day Iran launched a salvo of missiles at Israel. And this weekend we saw the heaviest bombing of Lebanon yet with waves of air strikes there, as well as further Israeli attacks on Gaza. The Middle East, so often described as being on the brink, appears to be toppling over it. In today's show, we'll be talking about how the region has changed in the wake of the October 7th attacks. And I'm joined now by Josie Dahlap, our Middle East editor, and Greg Kallstrom, one of our Middle East correspondence. Josie, you were living in Tel Aviv at the time. What do you remember about that October day? Greg, as you saw the events of the day unfold, how aware were you, do you think, of what the consequences might be, of how far reaching this was going to be? Over by Hanukkah. One of the key questions after those October 7th attacks was how Israel would respond. And that decision, of course, ultimately came down to the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Our Israel correspondent, Anshel Fefer, who's based in Jerusalem, and indeed has written a book about him, has been reflecting on how October 7th changed the country's politics and divided its society. How far do you think then that the options now for Israel actually hinge on whether Netanyahu stays in power? And of course his actions have really affected Israel's reputation abroad, particularly amongst its sort of staunch allies. How far does that now change what it can do or what might happen? Okay, so let's turn to Gaza. Since Israel invaded the territory in October 2023, nearly 42,000 people in Gaza have been killed. And as we've said before, much of the territory has been reduced to rubble its housing stock, its infrastructure. Now Greg, over the summer you went into Gaza with Zaniamint and Beadows, our editor and chief. Let's just listen to a bit of what you saw there. And that recording comes from an edition of the Weekend Intelligence looking at what might happen after the war ends. Listeners can find it right next to this episode in your podcast app. And on this occasion, it's free, whether you're a subscriber to economist podcast Plus or not. Greg, of course, as we've heard, you were there on that trip. What strikes you some months down the line about your visit in the summer? Of course, you're right, Greg. We talk about war aims. We talk about strategy. We talk about destruction, but at the nub end of this conflict, are millions of people trying to press on, trying to cope with the war that has torn apart their lives and their homes? Josie, what sense do you have of the response of the Palestinians and their sense of themselves? Greg, Josie talks about despair. She talks about hopelessness. Presumably there's a huge amount of rage too. Surely some of this action has bred a new generation of militants. Josie Greg, we'll be back with some more questions in just a moment. We've already mentioned that in recent weeks, Israel's focus has shifted away from Gaza to its northern border. And two weeks ago, of course, there were exploding pages that targeted thousands of members of his boiler. Last week, after days of rocket and missile exchanges between the two sides, Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. And the Lebanese authorities say that since then, over a thousand people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Abe Rukh correspondent, Gareth Brown, sent us a dispatch from there. We are all the resistance. It's a sobering and Greg, you've lived in Lebanon, you've lived in Beirut. Is Israel biting off more than it can chew? Is it aware of how deep the consequences could be? And of course, Iran and Israel now seem to be an inch away from all-out war. Before October the 7th, the Middle East was not an entirely happy place. There were lots of people who felt their rights were violated. Their territory was occupied, but the status quo was far less violent than this. And we've had a year of awful superlatives. We've had the worst massacre in Israel's history. We've had the deadliest war in Palestinian history. We've had Iran and Israel directly attacking each other, and an unprecedented level of political assassinations. Is there any hope for peace in the Middle East? Thank you, Greg. Thank you so much for talking to me today. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence. Do let us know what you think of the show. You can get in touch at podcast at economist.com. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Hello and welcome to the intelligence from the Economist. I'm your host Rosie Bloor. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the event shaping your world. The US election is so close that the result in a few key states could decide its outcome. As part of our series on these swing states, today we travel deep into Arizona. And you could call her style Jane Austen in modern Ireland with a dash of SNM. That at least is our correspondent's assessment of Sally Rooney, whose new book Intermezzo is her richest work yet. But first, this is Golden Week in China celebrating a special day in a special year. Chinese soldiers raise flags over Tiananmen Square to commemorate the country's national day when Mao Zedong declared the People's Republic. And this anniversary is particularly special because it marks 75 years of Chinese Communist Party rule, a span that has been marked by extreme repression, iron control and enormous progress. It's a combination that today's leaders continue to execute all at the same time. But this year's weeklong holiday comes amid signs that Xi Jinping is finally whizing up to the fact that his country's economy is no longer quite so golden. Central bank officials have unveiled new stimulus plans that have sent the markets upwards. And news has leaked of further easing measures expected soon. Simon, you say this is somewhat belatedly? Explain the timing. Why is this happening now? Simon, explain to me how big a shift this is for Xi Jinping. OK, let's talk about the specifics. Tell me, first of all, about this idea of cash payments. It's a fascinating situation where you want to disguise your stimulus. What about the push on the stock market? And aside from the dizzying rise in stock prices, how successful might this other package of stimulus be? Whenever anyone's looking at the Chinese economy, they've also got an eye on the global economy. How much effect might this have beyond China? Boosting its bottom line. Simon, thank you so much. Great to talk to you. And to hear about a very different side of China, do listen to Drum Tower, our China podcast, which has just aired a two-part interview with Michael Covric, a Canadian former diplomat who was imprisoned by the Chinese government for nearly three years. It's an incredible story told to us for the first time. In 2020, Democrats got a surprise result in Arizona. The state known for its free-wheeling libertarianism voted for Joe Biden for president. Since then, Democrats have also won the governorship and held both Senate seats, a feat not accomplished in Arizona for more than 70 years. Much of that swing came down to the Democratic tilt of Arizona's biggest county, where many Latino voters live. But Democrats may not do as well this time. As part of a series on the swing states that will decide America's presidential election, today we're delving into Arizona. And the voters there, who could determine whether the state stays blue or switches to red. So why are Arizona's Latinos behaving so differently? And his immigration likely to be such a strong force this time as well amongst Latinos. So we keep hearing about Harris and immigration, but what does this tell us about how it will play in the campaign more broadly? And for more on the swing states, this Friday, checks and balance our US politics podcast will be looking at Pennsylvania. You'll need to be a subscriber to listen. Her debut, Conversations with Friends, was adapted for television in 2022. I've missed you. That's it for this episode of The Intelligence. Do let us know what you think of the show.

        "text_corpus": " In my years as a journalist in China, there's one evening that stands out. It was December 2018. The foreign community in Beijing was in shock. A former Canadian diplomat turned researcher, Michael Coghry, had just been snatched from the streets of the Chinese capital by secret police. Late that winter night, a friend of Coghry had gotten in touch and asked me to join a few fellow foreign correspondents for a briefing from an eyewitness to his detention. It was late and the night was polluted and cold. I cycled to one of the city's diplomatic compounds, a well-guarded cluster of concrete office buildings and apartments, off limits to ordinary Chinese. It took us a while to decide on a safe place to meet. I remember walking around in the dark with the handful of colleagues. Finally, we ended up in the kitchen of a newspaper office and there we met Coghry's partner. Someone many of us knew as a China researcher and analyst. It was an intensely cold, war-ish moment. We could have been in Moscow in the 1960s. And for that small band of journalists sitting there sipping our late night tea, this detention was more than a personal crisis for Michael Coghry and his loved ones. It was more than a big news story. It was also our biggest fear, playing out in front of us. More than China lived with the knowledge that somewhere out of sight, China's security machine is watching. Now it has shown itself. Back in 2018, Coghryx was a name I knew, but I'd never met him in person. Now, in 2024, he's talking publicly for the first time about his years in detention in China. Coghryx partner was almost six months pregnant. Soon, Coghryx was accused of crimes against state security. In reality, he was a hostage, a Canadian citizen caught up in the crossfire of the China U.S. rivalry. His plight became a diplomatic incident that made headlines around the world. In all, he spent a thousand nineteen days in detention. But for Coghryx, each day was a struggle to endure. Now, on the third anniversary of his release, Michael Coghryx has lessons to share. I'm David Rene, the economist Geopolitics Editor. And over the next two episodes of DrumTire, I'll be talking with Michael Coghryx about his detention. And what it tells us about the China of Xi Jinping. This is DrumTire from the Economist. I'm sitting in a hotel in Canada, face to face with a man whose fate haunted every Western diplomat, researcher and journalist in Beijing. In person, Coghryx's tall, dark and intense. And he takes me back to the years that he worked as a diplomat at the Canadian Embassy in China from 2014 to 2016. In 2017, Coghryx took leave of absence from the Canadian Foreign Service. He wanted to keep working on China, so he joined the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based conflict prevention organization. He lived in Hong Kong, but he commuted into Beijing, where he'd stay in a modern part of the city near the embassy districts. He lived in a futuristic compound called Sanleton Soho, shiny black and white skyscrapers designed by a Japanese architect. Coghryx found that even the layout of the city, with embassies in their own special districts far from the government headquarters, was like a system designed to keep foreigners from seeing too much. Coghryx is not the only foreigner to feel impossibly small face to face with Chinese power, but he thought that he still had a role to play, that the situation was becoming so worrying that anything he could do to shed light on China was his duty. In 2018, the year that Michael Covreg was detained, I was just beginning my second posting in China. For the foreign press school, even for foreign diplomats, working in China often felt like taking a calculated risk. Covreg was a citizen of Canada, a country that for a long time preferred not to see the risks or the dark sides of the world. Canada was an open trade-focused country that wants to be friends with every great part, including both China and America. But by 2018, with Donald Trump in the White House, it was getting harder for countries like Canada to wish geopolitics away. It was becoming a time to choose sides where the Canada liked it or not. America was asking allies to help it push back against what it saw as the China threat. And China was ready to punish countries that lent their support to those American efforts. In Xi Jinping's China, the authorities are less and less tolerant of foreigners asking questions. Research that would be normal elsewhere can be called spying. Michael Covreg's work evolved the normal business of diplomacy or journalism, making contacts, speaking to scholars, spotting business people with firsthand knowledge of what's happening out on the ground. Covreg is clear about why his work was different from spying. Unlike diplomats, spies are tasked with stealing secrets, information they're not supposed to have, and they will bribe and coerce and blackmail to get what they need. Now, the International Crisis Group, he was trying to understand some of the most sensitive issues in Chinese foreign policy. And he was also interested in understanding China's neighbor North Korea, a hermit kingdom and headache for the whole region. China's border region with North Korea is a tightly police place. Diplomats and journalists traveling there often struggle to get a sense of what's going on. One contact for many of them was Michael Spavall, a Canadian entrepreneur who ran travel tours into North Korea. Big first met Spavall when he was working his secondary role at the embassy as a vice consul, looking after the welfare of far-flung Canadian citizens. Spavall lived on the Chinese side of the North Korean border. Sometimes when I think about the work of covering China as a journalist or researcher, I can see in my mind that I am a series of impenetrable black boxes with foreign analysts peering at them from the outside. There's the black box of China's political system. There are other specific mysteries who owns this big Chinese company who really controls that technology. And then there's China's security machine, the blackest box of all. By the middle of 2018, Trump's trade war had stoked tensions with Xi Jinping's China. And the loudest arguments were centered on a particular Chinese technology company, Huawei. Huawei had rapidly become the supplier of choice to telecom's giants around the world. The Trump administration wanted friends and allies to stop buying technology from Huawei. They accused the company of being controlled by the Communist Party, maybe even the people's liberation army. Chinese media retorted that Huawei is a private company whose only offense is to sell equipment that is better and cheaper than the kids made by Western rivals. Huawei is the one. American officials pointed to China's national security laws and argued that Huawei could be used as an arm of Chinese intelligence gathering. Huawei denied that when operating in foreign markets it said that the company would never, could never, hand over foreigners data to Chinese spy services. Huawei insisted that it abays local laws in each country and those laws would forbid it from spying for China. The once publicity shy company began sending out its best engineers as corporate lobbyists. The company's aim was to make trust into a technical engineering problem. Huawei's pitch to governments was look, look inside our 5G box, see there's no back door. But America was trying to convince allies that this was the wrong question. The question was a much simpler one. Why would you let a company from a country like China build something as vital to modern life as a 5G network? Then the US Department of Justice took a crowbar to the black box of Huawei. They decided to prosecute Mengwan Zhou, the company's CFO and the daughter of its founder. She was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver under an extradition treaty that the Americans have with Canada. Michael Covrick has thought again and again about his fateful decision to fly to Beijing just days after Mengwanjo's arrest in Canada. Mengwanjo has seen a tech royalty in China. In Edison's sometimes call her Huawei Zhang Gongju, the Princess of Huawei. Meng was one of Huawei's public faces around the world. Huawei is lucky. Here she is giving a presentation in Singapore a couple of months before her arrest. American prosecutors called Meng something more sinister, an agent of China's geopolitical influence. Specifically, their accuser of misleading a bank about Huawei's business dealings with Iran. Huawei said it was unaware of any wrongdoing by Mengwanjo. For the Trump administration this prosecution was a chance to shine a harsh light on Huawei and prove to the world that Chinese tech companies cannot be trusted. Learning that Mengwanjo would be on Canadian soil, the American Department of Justice asked Canada to arrest her and extradite her to the US. When President Donald Trump found out what had happened, he was reportedly angry. Told his national security adviser this was the equivalent of China arresting Ivanka Trump. And if Trump was cross, you could imagine that China's Communist Party leaders were furious. Straight after Mengwanjo's arrest. Chinese officials publicly warned that Canada would face serious consequences. Despite that threatening backdrop, Michael Coverage flew to Beijing on an important personal mission. He needed to help his partner pack up belongings to move with him to Hong Kong. On December 10th, Coverage was putting the finishing touches to talking points for the president of crisis group who was preparing a trip around Asia. After pressing send on the last email, he and his partner headed out for a late dinner. This was the beginning of a new life for them. They were going to live in Hong Kong together. They just booked a hotel for a Christmas holiday. And on their way back from dinner, they'd picked up some shopping and were carrying it back to their apartment in the Soho complex. Carverg was pushed into one of the waiting SUVs. He was blindfolded and handcuffed. Michael Covric was now inside the blackest box of all China's secret security state. Pinyan in that chair. He heard the charges against him and realized the terrible turn that his life had just taken. On that same day, a second Canadian, Michael Spavel, the entrepreneur who ran towards North Korea, was also detained in the northern Chinese border city where he lived. News media would quickly call them the two Michaels, hostages held in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Mengwan Zhou. Mengwan Zhou eventually reached a deal with America's Department of Justice, avoiding prosecution. But while that deal was being negotiated, the two Michaels were held for almost three years. Throughout that time, Michael Coverick made it his mission not just to resist, but to emerge a stronger and better person and with a clearer understanding of China. That's next week. Thank you for listening to DrumTah. Our editor is Poppy C. Bergmonte-Fury. Alizaje Ambatiste, Jehau Chen and Lucy Raw produced this episode. The executive producer is Hannah Moreno. Sound design is by Wade Hong Lim. DrumTah's music was composed by Jocelyn Tan. Last week on Drumta, we heard about the moment when Michael Cobraig, a former Canadian diplomat, was seized by state security agents on the 10th of December 2018. He was taken to a detention centre in a suburb of South Beijing. Very quickly, it became clear that Cobraig's detention, along with that of fellow Canadian Michael Spavall, was part of a much bigger geopolitical fight. A fight triggered by the arrest of Mengwan Zhou, a top executive at the Tecjiant Huawei. Not even Michael Cobraig knew for sure that he was a hostage. Behind the high speed trains and gleaming skyscrapers of modern China, the country's machinery of power is defiantly old school, a series of opaque black boxes. And on that cold December night in 2018, Michael Cobraig entered the blackest box of all. Three years after his release, for the first time, Cobraig is publicly sharing his account of the dark side of China's power. His story is one of courage and resilience against a machine designed to crush the human spirit. I'm David Rene, economist geopolitics editor. And in part two of my conversation with Michael Cobraig, I'll be asking how he endured the 1,019 days he spent in detention. And what that ordeal reveals about Xi Jinping's China. This is Drumter from the Economist. in southern Beijing. It's a sprawling site near an old airport. You could not know it then, but he would be locked up in that complex for nearly three years. Meanwhile, beyond the walls of the detention center, the gravity of his situation was growing clearer, especially as a second Canadian, Michael Spavall was arrested. Spavall ran cultural tours into North Korea. He was best known for his role helping Dennis Rodman, the basketballer, visit that country and meet Kim Jong-un its leader. In those years, many foreign diplomats and journalists had contact with Spavall. He was a rare Korean-speaking westerner, living near China's border with North Korea. Cobraig knew Spavall but not well. He recalls him as a source of travel advice and anecdotes about North Korea, but not as a source of information about China. With the news that Michael Spavall's detention, the world's media dubbed Cobraig and Spavall the two Michaels. The crisis began with Canada's arrest of Mengwan Zhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and Dorser of the company's founder. Meng was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver, but Canadian officers were actually enforcing an American indictment. At a keyster of misrepresenting Huawei's compliance with US sanctions on Iran. Canada's position was painful. Its citizens were being held in China, but under the terms of its extradition treaty with America, Meng's fate rested in American hands. The fast route to resolving the case would involve a plea bargain with Mengad Missing Guilt on at least one charge, but the US Department of Justice controlled that process, and admitting guilt, was something Meng refused to do. For China's part, its foreign ministry said they were investigating two foreigners for allegedly gathering state secrets. It just so happened that they were Canadians, citizens of the country that arrested Mengwan Zhou, and arrest that China warned publicly would have severe consequences. This foreign ministry denied that the two Michaels were hostages. As winter gripped North China, Covrig found himself taken into solitary confinement in He was under constant surveillance by two plainclothes guards inside his cell. He was being held by the Beijing Division of the MSS, the Ministry of State Security, and his chief interrogator lectured him about the awesome powers of the security state under Xi Jinping. after rice gruel for breakfast, a three-hour interrogation, a grim lunch, and then another round of interrogation. Then dinner, often followed by a third bout of questioning. What were they asking you? There was one more thing that interrogators asked Covrig, and that worried Western embassies in Beijing. Michael Covrig was being questioned about his work when he was at Canada's embassy. Work which should have been protected by the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. At first, Coffin refused to cooperate with his Chinese interrogators. He would speak but in deliberately bad Chinese to slow things down or at other times in rapid colloquial English. Described as the physical experience, what was it like? Often when detainees left their cells, they were handcuffed, blindfolded and strapped into a wheelchair. As Coffin was wheeled along, he would sometimes tell himself, yay, though I roll through the shadow of the valley of death, I will fear no evil. Having an isolation, his interrogations became a cruel sort of release. Maintaining a wall of non-cooperation was wearing Coffin down. As a suspect in a national security case, China's secret police could hold Coffin for up to six months without access to a lawyer. A few weeks into his detention, the acting Canadian ambassador told him to prepare himself for being held for the full six months. Across Beijing, several miles north of the Da Hongmen detention center, I had coffee with diplomats from another embassy. They told me that colleagues were frightened the Coffin was being asked about his work as a diplomat. In February 2019, I was invited to a Chinese New Year reception by government ministry. Over dinner, I had a chance to ask a Chinese official what his government gained from frightening other countries. His tone turned icy. Canada made a political choice to please America and anger China. The official told me. Now he said, Canada must feel pain. So the next time America asks for such help, every ally will think twice. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Canada's justice system was offering very different rights to Mengwan Zhou. The Huawei executive who's arrest triggered this whole crisis. Advised by some of Vancouver's finest corporate lawyers, Meng secured her release on bail from a judge for $10 million Canadian dollars. She was ordered to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and confined at night to her own home in Vancouver. By day, she was free to eat at restaurants or go shopping. Local media reported that she was taking painting and English lessons. In Beijing, coverage conditions were very different. Books and letters that his family and friends had sent to him were kept from him for many months. He learned of this during 30 minute meetings with Canadian embassy diplomats. And those happened once a month. His only contact with the world outside. Now that he understood that he'd been here for the longer haul, he had to work out a way to cooperate selectively without giving anything valuable away. During interrogations, he would fill up the time by reciting old reports from the International Crisis Group. He would describe meetings with Chinese officials that he knew had been recorded at the time by note takers. And he protected some of his contacts, such as human rights activists or people from ethnic minorities. In the hours between interrogations, he developed a routine for keeping body and minds together. Exercise was also a way of showing his willpower. Convert told me that in the cramped confines of his cell, he found other ways to focus his mind. You get a pass for quite a lot of things. He set out to take mental journeys through time and space. In early April 2019, Coverage interrogator had news for him. Later, Canadian diplomats were allowed to hold up photographs of his baby during consular visits. He could look at them from a distance. On May 6th, 2019, after nearly six months in solitary confinement, Covrig was formally arrested. He was charged with stealing state secrets. He was fingerprinted, photographed, and given a grey polyester uniform and a number, 190-13. He was moved to a new building within the same state security compound. Now, he had cellmates. Ironically, some were officials who had taken money from foreign powers to sell secrets. Now, they were locked in together. In a detention site, bristling with cameras, people were cautious about what they said. Still, Covrig learned a lot about the workings of the machine. His cellmates' reactions to being locked up span the spectrum from indignation to shame. Covrig's new cell afforded him a glimpse of something he hadn't seen for six months. Could you see the sky? And that was the first time you'd seen this guy in six months? By late summer 2019, Covrig had been in detention for nine months. And from my office in Beijing, I found myself writing about Huawei a lot. Seeing it officials from the Trump administration were touring world capitals, telling allies that they would be seen as less reliable by America if they allowed Huawei to build their 5G telecoms networks. Huawei pushed back. The once secretive company became suddenly accessible. I was contacted by Huawei executives wanting to explain that they were an innocent private company, not an arm of the Chinese state or military. In an early September 2019, the economist was granted an interview with Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei. Ren is Mengwanjo's father. The location was the palatial Huawei campus in South China. When asked whether Huawei was a front for the Chinese government, Ren Zhengfei pleaded modesty. His private company was not grand enough to represent the national interest, he said. Huawei is Huawei. China is China. Ren says there. Huawei is not glorious enough to be able to represent China. Sitting there in Ren Zhengfei's spectacular office with the columns from an imitation Greek temple and sculptures all around him, I found myself thinking about the conditions of the two Michaels' detention. I asked Ren Zhengfei what he thought about the fact that the two Canadians had no access to lawyers, unlike his daughter. What do you think of the conditions of the detention of the two Canadian citizens? Did Jin Yang go shijin or she used to do that? He batted my question away. He said he didn't know anything about the details of their detention and he defended his daughter's innocence. At the same month of September, Justin Trudeau, Canada's Prime Minister, appointed a new ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, former global head of McKinsey. Barton is a tall, distinguished looking CEO type, well connected with senior Chinese officials, but even he found himself subjected to state security rules. In his meetings with Covric, if guards heard the two men referring to the case, they would cut off the conversation. So Barton and Covric learned to exchange information through hints and indirect references. In December, Covric passed on a specific message. He was founding a book club, asking family and friends to read the same titles as him and share their thoughts in letters. Then, a month later, in January 2020, consular visits stopped. Covric had no idea why. There's an epidemic. The detainees were told. Bit by bit, Covric learned about the global spread of Covid-19 from new cellmates who just come in from the outside. As the pandemic dragged on, Canadian, American and Chinese officials and lawyers were groping towards a deal to end this political standoff. And in June 2020, 18 months into Covric's detention, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson broke with the usual line that there was no connection between Mengwanjo's case and the two Michaels. Instead, the spokesperson said, if Mengwanjo is released, it could open up space for a resolution of the two Canadians' detention. And by the end of that same year, America had a new president, Joe Biden. Canada pushed the new administration hard to reach a deal with Huawei and China. American officials seemed newly open to a solution. But there was a catch. Meng would have to admit to some form of guilt and she insisted she had done nothing wrong. For the two Canadians, time inside was passing achingly slowly. For the first two years of Covric's detention, he was not allowed a single phone call to his family. He spent a lot of his time reading, trying to impose some meaning on his ordeal. In March 2021, two years and four months into Covric's detention, he was finally put on trial. China was still in lockdown. The Covric was dressed in white hazmat overalls, gloves, goggles and a face mask before being taken to a basement courtroom in Beijing. Shackled, half mummified, Covric's only audience was a panel of impassive judges, prosecutors, and his own Chinese lawyers who wielded no power at all in this cruel parody of justice. The court rules granted Covric one chance to speak. He seized it. In a communist-led country, for a defendant to plead not guilty, is no ordinary act of defiance. Confessions are integral to the system. By refusing to put on a show of guilt and remorse, Covric was declaring that he remained a free man. Years before his detention, before he even came to China, Michael Covric was in a punk-rock In summer 2021, band members published a song calling for his release. The outside world had not forgotten the two Michaels. Covric's father was busy raising their daughter and rallying China researchers and NGOs to write open letters. And though he was legally separated from Vina Nagibulla, who is now his ex-wife, she was also a tireless campaigner for his release. In September 2021, more than a thousand days after the standoff began, a deal to end it was done. Mangwanzhou pleaded not guilty to the US indictment that had triggered her arrest in Canada. She conceded only that she had made untrue statements to a foreign bank about Huawei's business dealings with Iran. That was enough for America, so Canada was free to let her go. With a deal in place, Covric's freedom was tantalizingly close. He knew that negotiations were well advanced, but in his last days in detention, his captors told him that he needed to confess. That wasn't actually part of the deal he would later discover, but the state security officers at Dahongmen pushed Covric hard. How did they do that? Covric refused to confess. He wanted to go home on his terms. On the 23rd of September, in the small hours of the morning, Michael Covric was blindfolded in handcuffs one last time. He was driven to Tianjin, to an airport terminal reserved for official flights. He saw his fellow Canadian captive, Michael Spavall, for the first time in years. The two men hugged. Covric had to sign a medical release for bail. That meant that by the terms of the agreement, he wasn't being formally acquitted, just allowed to leave China on health grounds. The two Michaels boarded a Gulfstream jet. Ambassador Barton flew with them, but Covric only relaxed once the plane had left Chinese airspace, and he could see Japan below them. I've read press reporting that you kissed the tarmac at a Canadian airfield, is that right? He was now on the way to meet his two and a half year old Dorsa for the first time. If China wanted the two Michaels departure to be almost invisible, it made Mengwan Joe's return into a patriotic spectacle. An air-China plane flew mongred to the giant southern city of Shenzhen, where Huawei is based. She emerged in a red dress to be greeted by flag-waving crowds and welcome messages blazing from the side of Shenzhen's tallest skyscraper. State TV carried the landing live as if she were a returning astronaut. Meng stood in front of the cameras and said that looking back at the last three years, she understood more than ever that the fate of individuals, enterprises and the state are unequivocally bound together. The motherland, she said, is our firmest rock and only when the motherland is prosperous, can enterprises develop steadily and people be happy and safe. At the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing, a journalist asked whether Covric and Spavall had been hostages swapped for Meng. The ministry's chief spokesperson Huachunying called for the cases completely different. It is crying wolf, she said, to suggest that China would detain foreigners on trumped-up charges. Even now, the story is making headlines. In March 2024, Michaels Spavall reached a settlement with the Canadian government for an undisclosed sum. An early report in the Globe and Mail newspaper alleged that Spavall was ready to sue his own government, blaming Canada and Michael Covric for using him as a source of information about North Korea. Covric is adamant that his work was the usual business of diplomacy and think tank research. Canada's government is also clear saying that China's arbitrary detention of Michael Spavall and Michael Covric was unjust and unacceptable. But simply, that judgement wouldn't change even if China sincerely believed that Covric's information gathering crossed its own red lines. He was taken because he was Canadian and he and Michael Spavall were released on the same day that Mengwanzhou flew home almost to the minute. The story of the two Michaels is a tale of hostage taking. Big ads that he was in close contact with Spavall after their release, hosting the businessman at his home. Spavall was asked for comment via his lawyer. Perhaps the hardest thing after losing three years from your life is to extract some meaning from the experience. Michael Covric wants the world to see his hostage taking as a lesson. Do you feel safe from China as long as you feel that the system has no more claim on you or does it affect how you travel where you travel? But that's a genuine dilemma, right? Because China is very, very big and absolutely indispensable to a whole bunch of important things, some of which are solving climate change, others of which are making iPhones. So what is your kind of conclusion as to how we deal with that country? And what it did to you? Coverage loss conclusion is deeply personal. Thank you for listening to Drumter. Next week my co-host Alice will be taking you on a journey from Colombia through some of the wildest parts of the planet with Chinese migrants hoping to cross Mexico's border into America. Why are so many people taking such huge risks to swap the China dream for the American one? And for those who make it to the other side, is it worth it? Our editor is Poppy C. Begmont-Afure. Lucy Raw, Alize Jean-Baptiste and Gerhard Chen produce this episode with help from Stevie Hertz. The executive producers are Hannah Moreno and Chris Impey. Sound design is by Nico Rofast and Tingley Lim. Drumter's music was composed by Jocelyn Tan. In my years as a journalist in China, there's one evening that stands out. It was December 2018. The foreign community in Beijing was in shock. A former Canadian diplomat turned researcher, Michael Covrig, had just been snatched from the streets of the Chinese capital by secret police. Late that winter night, a friend of Covrig's got in touch and asked me to join a few fellow foreign correspondents for a briefing from an eyewitness to his detention. It was late and the night was polluted and cold. I cycled to one of the city's diplomatic compounds, a well-guarded cluster of concrete office buildings and apartments, off limits to ordinary Chinese. It took us a while to decide on a safe place to meet. I remember walking around in the dark with the handful of colleagues. Finally, we ended up in the kitchen of a newspaper office and there we met Covrig's partner. Someone many of us knew as a China researcher and analyst. It was an intensely cold, war-ish moment. We could have been in Moscow in the 1960s. And for that small band of journalists sitting there sipping our late night tea, this detention was more than a personal crisis for Michael Covrig and his loved ones. It was more than a big news story. It was also our biggest fear playing out in front of us. Foreigners in China live with the knowledge that somewhere out of sight, China's security machine is watching. Now, it has shown itself. Back in 2018, Covrig's was a name I knew, but I'd never met him in person. Now, in 2024, he's talking publicly for the first time about his years in detention in China. I will get out of this. Covrig's partner was almost six months pregnant. Soon, Covrig was accused of crimes against state security. In reality, he was a hostage, a Canadian citizen caught up in the crossfire of the China U.S. rivalry. His plight became a diplomatic incident that made headlines around the world. by the Chinese government. In all, he spent a thousand nineteen days in detention. But for Covrig, each day was a struggle to endure. Now, on the third anniversary of his release, Michael Covrig has lessons to share. I'm David Rene, the economist geopolitics editor. And over the next two episodes of Drumta, I'll be talking with Michael Covrig about his detention and what it tells us about the China of Xi Jinping. This is Drumta from the economist. I'm sitting in a hotel in Canada, face to face with a man whose fate haunted every western diplomat, researcher and journalist in Beijing. In person, Covrig is tall, dark and intense. And he takes me back to the years that he worked as a diplomat at the Canadian Embassy in China from 2014 to 2016. In 2017, Covrig took leave of absence from the Canadian Foreign Service. He wanted to keep working on China, so he joined the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based conflict prevention organization. He lived in Hong Kong, but he commuted into Beijing, where he'd stay in a modern part of the city near the embassy districts. He lived in a futuristic compound called Sanleton Soho, shiny black and white skyscrapers designed by a Japanese architect. gleaming parts of Beijing. Covrig found that even the layout of the city, with embassies in their own special districts far from the government headquarters, was like a system designed to keep foreigners B walking, you've got very long blocks to cross. Covrig is not the only foreigner to feel impossibly small face to face with Chinese power. But he thought that he still had a role to play, that the situation was becoming so worrying that anything he could do to shed light on China was his In 2018, the year that Michael Covreg was detained, I was just beginning my second posting in China. For the foreign press school, even for foreign diplomats, working in China often felt like taking Covreg was a citizen of Canada, a country that for a long time preferred not to see the risks or the dark sides of the world. Canada was an open, trade-focused country that wants to be friends with every great power, including both China and America. But by 2018, with Donald Trump in the White House, it was getting harder for countries like Canada to wish geopolitics away. It was becoming a time to choose sides where the Canada liked it or not. America was asking allies to help it push back against what it saw as the China threat. And China was ready to punish countries that lent their support to those American efforts. In Xi Jinping's China, the authorities are less and less tolerant of foreigners asking questions. Research that would be normal elsewhere can be called spying. Michael Covreg's work evolved the normal business of diplomacy or journalism, making contacts, speaking to scholars, spotting business people with first-hand knowledge of what's nosy questions. Covreg is clear about why his work was different from spying. Unlike diplomats, spies are tasked with stealing secrets, information they're not supposed to have, and they will bribe and coerce and blackmail to get what they need. At the International Crisis Group, he was trying to understand some of the most sensitive understanding China's neighbor North Korea, a hermit kingdom and headache for the whole region. and was being increasingly menacing. China's border region with North Korea is a tightly police place. diplomats and journalists traveling there often struggle to get a sense of what's going on. One contact for many of them was Michael Spavall, a Canadian entrepreneur who ran travel tours into North Korea. Covering first met Spavall when he was working his secondary role at the embassy as a vice consul, looking after the welfare of far-flung Canadian citizens. Spavall lived on the Chinese side of the North Korean border. He liked to live there because it was a good place Sometimes when I think about the work of covering China as a journalist or researcher, I can see in my mind that I, a series of impenetrable black boxes, with foreign analysts peering at them from the outside. There's the black box of China's political system. There are other specific mysteries who owns this big Chinese company who really controls that technology and then there's China's security machine, the blackest box of all. By the middle of 2018, Trump's trade war had stoked tensions with Xi Jinping's China and the loudest arguments were centered on a particular Chinese technology company, Huawei. the supplier of choice to telecom's giants around the world. The Trump administration wanted friends and allies to stop buying technology from Huawei. They accused the company had been controlled by the Communist Party, maybe even the People's Liberation Army. Chinese media retorted that Huawei is a private company whose only offense is to sell equipment that is better and cheaper than the kit made by Western rivals. American officials pointed to China's national security laws and argued that Huawei could be used as an arm of Chinese intelligence gathering. Huawei denied that when operating in foreign markets, it said that the company would never, could never, hand over foreigners data to Chinese spy services. Huawei insisted that it abays local laws in each country and those laws would forbid it from spying for China. The once publicity shy company began sending out its best engineers as corporate lobbyists. The company's aim was to make trust into a technical engineering problem. Huawei's pitched governments was look, look inside our 5G box, see there's no back door. But America was trying to convince allies that this was the wrong question. The question was a much simpler one. Why would you let a company from a country like China build something as vital to modern life as a 5G network? Then the US Department of Justice took a crowbar to the black box of Huawei. They decided to prosecute Mengwan Zhou, the company's CFO and the daughter of its founder. She was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver under an extradition that the Americans have with Canada. in taking hostages there. Michael Covric has thought again and again about his fateful decision to fly to Beijing just days after Mengwan Zhou's arrest in Canada. I might have waited. Mengwan Zhou has seen a tech royalty in China. Netizens sometimes call her Huawei Zhang Gongju, the Princess of Huawei. Meng was one of Huawei's public faces around the world. Huawei is lucky. Here she is giving a presentation in Singapore a couple of months before her arrest. possible today. American prosecutors called Meng something more sinister, an agent of China's geopolitical influence. Specifically, they accused her of misleading a bank about Huawei's business dealings with Iran. Huawei said it was unaware of any wrongdoing by Mengwan devilated sanctions. For the Trump administration, this prosecution was a chance to shine a harsh light on Huawei and prove to the world that Chinese tech companies cannot be trusted. Learning that Mengwan Zhou would be on Canadian soil, the American Department of Justice asked Canada to arrest her and extradite her to the US. When President Donald Trump found out what had happened, he was reportedly angry. He told his national security adviser this was the equivalent of China arresting Ivanka Trump. And if Trump was cross, you could imagine the China's Communist Party leaders were furious. Straight after Meng Wanzhou's arrest, Chinese officials publicly warned that Canada would face serious consequences. Despite that threatening backdrop, Michael Coverage flew to Beijing on an important personal mission. He needed to help his partner pack up belongings to move with him to Hong Kong. On December 10, Coverage was putting the finishing touches to talking points for the presence of Crisis Group, who was preparing a trip around Asia. After pressing send on the last email, he and his partner headed out for a late dinner. This was the beginning of a new life for them. They were going to live in Hong Kong together. They just booked a hotel for a Christmas holiday. And on their way back from dinner, they'd picked up some shopping and were carrying it back to their Carverg was pushed into one of the waiting SUVs. He was blindfolded and handcuffed. Michael Covric was now inside the blackest box of all China's secret security state. Pinyan in that chair, he heard the charges against him and realized the terrible turn On that same day, a second Canadian, Michael Spavall, the entrepreneur who ran towards North Korea, was also detained in the northern Chinese border city where he lived. News media would quickly call them the two Michaels. Hostages held in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Mengwan Zhou. Mengwan Zhou eventually reached a deal with America's Department of Justice, avoiding prosecution. But while that deal was being negotiated, the two Michaels were held for almost three years. Throughout that time, Michael Coverick made it his mission not just to resist, but to emerge a stronger and better person and with a clearer understanding of China. That's next week. Thank you for listening to DrumTah. Our editor is poppy c bagmontafuri. Alize Jean-Baptiste Jihad Chen and Lucy Raw produced this episode. The executive producer is Hannah Moreno. Sounder's eye is by Wade Hong Lim. DrumTah's music was composed by Jocelyn Tan. Last week on DrumTow, we heard about the moment when Michael Covric, a former Canadian diplomat, was seized by state security agents on the 10th of December 2018. He was taken to a detention centre in a suburb of South Beijing. Very quickly, it became clear that Covric's detention, along with that of fellow Canadian Michael Spavall, was part of a much bigger geopolitical fight. A fight triggered by the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Tecjant Huawei. Not even Michael Covric knew for sure that he was a hostage. Behind the high speed trains and gleaming skyscrapers of modern China, the country's machinery of power is defiantly old school, a series of opaque black boxes. And on that cold December night in 2018, Michael Covric entered the blackest box of all. Three years after his release, for the first time, Covric is publicly sharing his account of the dark side of Chinese power. His story is one of courage and resilience against a machine designed to crush the human spirit. The world's most powerful technology. I'm David Renny, economist geopolitics editor. And in part two of my conversation with Michael Covric, I'll be asking how he endured the 1,019 days he spent in detention. And what that ordeal reveals about Xi Jinping's China. This is Drumta from the Economist. Michael Covric had been taken to Da Hongmen, the Beijing State Security Detention Center in southern Beijing. It's a sprawling site near an old airport. Covric could not know it then, but he would be locked up in that complex for nearly three years. Meanwhile, beyond the walls of the detention center, the gravity of his situation was growing clearer. Especially as a second Canadian, Michael's Spavol was arrested. Spavol ran cultural tours into North Korea. He was best known for his role helping Dennis Rodman, the basketballer, visit that country and meet Kim Jong-un, its leader. In those years, many foreign diplomats and journalists had contact with Spavol. He was a rare Korean-speaking westerner living near China's border with North Korea. Covric newsspavol, but not well. He recalls him as a source of travel advice and anecdotes about North Korea, but not as a source of information about China. With the news that Michael's Spavol's detention, the world's media dubbed Covric and Spavol the two Michaels. The crisis began with Canada's arrest of Mengwan Zhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and Dorser of the company's founder. Meng was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver, but Canadian officers were actually enforcing an American indictment. That accused her of misrepresenting Huawei's compliance with US sanctions on Iran. Canada's position was painful. Its citizens were being held in China, but under the terms of its extradition treaty with America, Meng's fate rested in American hands. The fast route to resolving the case would involve a plea bargain, with Meng admitting guilt on at least one charge, but the US Department of Justice controlled that process, and admitting guilt was something Meng refused to do. For China's part, its foreign ministry said they were investigating two foreigners for allegedly gathering state secrets. It just so happened that they were Canadians, citizens of the country that arrested Mengwan Zhou, and arrest that China warned publicly would have severe consequences. China's foreign ministry denied that the two Michaels were hostages. As winter gripped North China, Covert found himself taken into solitary confinement in a small cell. Though Covert was in solitary, he was under constant surveillance by two plain-closed guards inside his cell. He was being held by the Beijing Division of the MSS, the Ministry of State Security, and his chief interrogator lectured him about the awesome powers of the security state under Xi Jinping. Covert recalled the boasts. They kept him on a strict schedule. After rice grew for breakfast, a three-hour interrogation, a grim lunch, and then another round of interrogation, then dinner, often followed by a third bout of questioning. What were they asking you? There was one more thing that interrogators asked Covrig, and that worried Western embassies in Beijing. Michael Covrig was being questioned about his work when he was at Canada's embassy. Work which should have been protected by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. At first, Covr refused to cooperate with his Chinese interrogators. He would speak, but in deliberately bad Chinese to slow things down, or at other times, in rapid colloquial English. Described as the physical experience, what was it like? Often, when detainees left their cells, they were handcuffed, blindfolded, and strapped into a wheelchair. As Covrig was wheeled along, he would sometimes tell himself, ye, though I roll through the shadow of the valley of death, I will fear no evil. Living in isolation, his interrogations became a cruel sort of release. Maintaining a wall of non-cooperation was wearing Covrig down. As a suspect in a national security case, China's secret police could hold Covrig for up to six months without access to a lawyer. A few weeks into his detention, the acting Canadian ambassador told him to prepare himself for being held for the full six months. Across Beijing, several miles north of the Da Hongmen detention centre, I had coffee with diplomats from another embassy. They told me that colleagues were frightened that Covrig was being asked about his work as a diplomat. In February 2019, I was invited to a Chinese New Year reception by government ministry. Over dinner, I had a chance to ask a Chinese official what his government gained from frightening other countries. His tone turned icy. Canada made a political choice to please America and anger China, the official told me. Now he said, Canada must feel pain. So the next time America asks for such help, every ally will think twice. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Canada's justice system was offering very different rights to Mengwanjo, the Huawei executive who's arrest triggered this whole crisis. Advised by some of Vancouver's finest corporate lawyers, Meng secured her release on bail from a judge for $10 million Canadian dollars. She was ordered to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and confined at night to her own home in Vancouver. By day, she was free to eat at restaurants or go shopping. Local media reported that she was taking painting and English lessons. In Beijing, coverage conditions were very different. Books and letters that his family and friends had sent to him were kept from him for many months. He learned of this during 30-minute meetings with Canadian Embassy diplomats. And those happened once a month, his only contact with the world outside. Now that he understood that he'd be in here for the longer haul, he had to work out a way to cooperate selectively without giving anything valuable away. During interrogations, he would fill up the time by reciting old reports from the International Crisis Group. He would describe meetings with Chinese officials that he knew had been recorded at the time by note takers. And he protected some of his contacts, such as human rights activists or people from ethnic minorities. In the hours between interrogations, he developed a routine for keeping body and mind together. Exercise was also a way of showing his willpower. Covert told me that in the cramped confines of his cell, he found other ways to focus his mind. You get a pass for quite a lot of estate. He set out to take mental journeys through time and space. In early April 2019, Coverage Interrogator had news for him. Later, Canadian diplomats were allowed to hold up photographs of his baby during consular visits. He could look at them from a distance. On May 6, 2019, after nearly six months in solitary confinement, Covrig was formally arrested. He was charged with stealing state secrets. He was fingerprinted, photographed, and given a grey polyester uniform and a number, 190-13. He was moved to a new building within the same state security compound. Now, he had cellmates. Ironically, some were officials who had taken money from foreign powers to sell secrets. Now, they were locked in together. In a detention site, bristling with cameras, people were cautious about what they said. Still, Covrig learned a lot about the workings of the machine. His cellmates' reactions to being locked up, span the spectrum from indignation to shame. Covrig's new cell afforded him a glimpse of something he hadn't seen for six months. Could you see this guy? That was the first time you'd seen this guy in six months? By late summer 2019, Covrig had been in detention for nine months, and from my office in Beijing, I found myself writing about Huawei a lot. Senior officials from the Trump administration were touring world capitals, telling allies that they would be seen as less reliable by America if they allowed Huawei to build their 5G telecoms networks. Huawei pushed back. The once secretive company became suddenly accessible. I was contacted by Huawei executives wanting to explain that they were an innocent private company, not an arm of the Chinese state or military. And in early September 2019, the economist was granted an interview with Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei. Ren is Mengwanjo's father. The location was the palatial Huawei campus in South China. When asked whether Huawei was a front for the Chinese government, Ren Zhengfei pleaded modesty. His private company was not grand enough to represent the national interest, he said. Huawei is Huawei. China is China. Ren says there. Huawei is not glorious enough to be able to represent China. Sitting there in Ren Zhengfei's spectacular office, with the columns from an imitation Greek temple and sculptures all around him, I found myself thinking about the conditions of the two Michaels' detention. I asked Ren Zhengfei what he thought about the fact that the two Canadians had no access to lawyers, unlike his daughter. What do you think of the conditions of the detention of the two Canadian citizens? Did Ren Zhengfei have a shishin or shishin? He battered my question away. He said he didn't know anything about the details of their detention, and he defended his daughter's innocence. That same month of September, Justin Trudeau, Canada's Prime Minister, appointed a new ambassador to China, Dominic Martin, former global head of McKinsey. Martin is a tool to distinguish looking CEO type, well connected with senior Chinese officials, but even he found himself subjected to state security rules. In his meetings with Covrig, if guards heard the two men referring to the case, they would cut off the conversation. So, Martin and Covrig learned to exchange information through hints and indirect references. In December, Covrig passed on a specific message. He was found in a book club, asking family and friends to read the same titles as him, and share their thoughts in letters. Then, a month later, in January 2020, consular visits stopped. Covrig had no idea why. There's an epidemic. The detainees were told. Bit by bit, Covrig learned about the global spread of Covid-19 from new cellmates who just come in from the outside. As the pandemic dragged on, Canadian, American and Chinese officials and lawyers were grouping towards a deal to end this political standoff. And in June 2020, 18 months into Covrig's detention. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson broke with the usual line that there was no connection between Mengwanjo's case and the two Michaels. Instead, the spokesperson said, if Mengwanjo is released, it could open up space for a resolution of the two Canadians' detention. And by the end of that same year, America had a new president, Joe Biden. Canada pushed the new administration hard to reach a deal with Huawei and China. American officials seemed newly open to a solution. But there was a catch. Meng would have to admit to some form of guilt and she insisted she had done nothing wrong. For the two Canadians, time inside was passing achingly slowly. For the first two years of Covrig's detention, he was not allowed a single phone call to his family. He spent a lot of his time reading, trying to impose some meaning on his ordeal. In March 2021, two years and four months into Covrig's detention, he was finally put on trial. China was still in lockdown. So Covrig was dressed in white hazmat overalls, gloves, goggles and a face mask, before being taken to a basement courtroom in Beijing. Shackled, half mummified, Covrig's only audience was a panel of impassive judges, prosecutors, and his own Chinese lawyers who wielded no power at all in this cruel parody of justice. But court rules granted Covrig one chance to speak. He seized it. In a communist-led country, for a defendant to plead not guilty, is no ordinary act of defiance. Confessions are integral to the system. By refusing to put on a show of guilt and remorse, Covrig was declaring that he remained a free man. Years before his detention, before he even came to China, Michael Covrig was in a punk rock band, bankrupt. In summer 2021, band members published a song calling for his release. The outside world had not forgotten the two Michaels. Covrig's partner was busy raising their daughter and rallying China researchers and NGOs to write open letters. And though he was legally separated from Vina Naji Buller, who is now his ex-wife, she was also a tireless campaigner for his release. In September 2021, more than a thousand days after the standoff began, a deal to end it was done. Meng Wanzhou pleaded not guilty to the US indictment that had triggered her arrest in Canada. She conceded only that she had made untrue statements to a foreign bank about Huawei's business dealings with Iran. That was enough for America, so Canada was free to let her go. With a deal in place, Covrig's freedom was tantalizingly close. He knew that negotiations were well advanced, but in his last days in detention, his captors told him that he needed to confess. That wasn't actually part of the deal he would later discover, but the state security officers at Dahongmen pushed Covrig hard. How did they do that? Covrig refused to confess. He wanted to go home on his terms. On the 23rd of September, in the small hours of the morning, Michael Covrig was blindfolded in handcuffed one last time. He was driven to Tianjin, to an airport terminal reserved for official flights. He saw his fellow Canadian captive, Michael Spavall, for the first time in years, the two men hugged. Covrig had to sign a medical release for bail. That meant that by the terms of the agreement, he wasn't being formally acquitted, just allowed to leave China on health grounds. The two Michaels boarded a Gulfstream jet. Ambassador Barton flew with them, but Covrig only relaxed once the plane had left Chinese airspace, and he could see Japan below them. I've read press reporting that you kissed the tarmac at a Canadian airfield, is that right? Yeah. He was now on the way to meet his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter for the first time. If China wanted the two Michaels departure to be almost invisible, it made Mengwan Joe's return into a patriotic spectacle. An air-China plane flew Meng to the giant southern city of Shenzhen, where Huawei is based. She emerged in a red dress to be greeted by flag-waving crowds and welcome messages blazing from the side of Shenzhen's tallest skyscraper. State TV carried the landing live as if she were a returning astronaut. Meng stood in front of the cameras and said that looking back at the last three years, she understood more than ever that the fate of individuals, enterprises and the state are unequivocally bound together. The motherland, she said, is our firmest rock and only when the motherland is prosperous, can enterprises develop steadily and people be happy and safe. At the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing, a journalist asked whether Covrig and Spavall had been hostages swapped for Meng. The ministry's chief spokesperson Hua Chunying called the cases completely different. It is crying wolf, she said, to suggest that China would detain foreigners on trumped-up charges. Even now, the story is making headlines. In March 2024, Michael Spavall reached a settlement with the Canadian government for an undisclosed sum. An early report in the Globe and Mail newspaper alleged that Spavall was ready to sue his own government, blaming Canada and Michael Covrig for using him as a source of information about North Korea. Covrig is adamant that his work was the usual business of diplomacy and think tank research. Canada's government is also clear saying that China's arbitrary detention of Michael Spavall and Michael Covrig was unjust and unacceptable. But simply, that judgment wouldn't change even if China sincerely believed that Covrig's information gathering crossed its own red lines. He was taken because he was Canadian and he and Michael Spavall were released on the same day that Meng Wanzhou flew home almost to the minute. The story of the two Michaels is a tale of hostage taking. Covrig adds that he was in close contact with Spavall after their release, hosting the businessman at his home. Spavall was asked for comment via his lawyer. Perhaps the hardest thing after losing three years from your life is to extract some meaning from the experience. Michael Covrig wants the world to see his hostage taking as a lesson. Do you feel safe from China's long arm? Or do you feel that the system has no more claim on you? Or does it affect how you travel? Where you travel? That's a genuine dilemma, right, because China is very, very big and absolutely indispensable to a whole bunch of important things, some of which are solving climate change, others of which are making iPhones. So what is your kind of conclusion as to how we deal with that country, given what it did to you? Coverage loss conclusion is deeply personal. Thank you for listening to Drumta. Next week my co-host Alice will be taking on a journey from Colombia through some of the wildest parts of the planet with Chinese migrants hoping to cross Mexico's border into America. Why are so many people taking such huge risks to swap the China dream for the American one? And for those who make it to the other side, is it worth it? Our editor is Poppy C. Bergmontafuri.

        "text_corpus": " The Economist Enormous amounts of money are being poured into generative AI and it's changing the nature of Silicon Valley. In the last year and a half or so venture capitalists have plowed nearly $95 billion into AI start-ups. But then you look at the size of open AI and it's clear that this is not your usual start-up. It's already become a monster. It's so big that it is changing the rules of the game in Silicon Valley. So the first thing is that a single investment in open AI could cost a billion dollars or more, which is way more than conventional start-ups. And this is because of the enormous resources that are needed to train the large language models behind open AI's apps such as chat GPT. Most venture capital firms cannot afford to stump up billions of dollars in one deal. Even the biggest may do no more than about a billion dollars of investment in the whole year on a variety of companies. So big tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, they're picking up the slack. They're the ones who are providing most of the money. Microsoft has invested 13 billion in open AI since 2019 and Amazon has invested 4 billion in anthropic, another AI firm just this year. So they provide the funding but they also provide something that is absolutely essential for the large language models, which is cloud computing. And that's why you see that in open AI's latest funding round, it's highly likely that Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Sovereign, wealth funds, in other words, the most deep pocketed companies on the planet are all going to take part, but not many VCs will. Well, they have alternatives. There are the companies that run on top of the large language models, although wizzy coding companies and customer service companies, which are expected to be built on the back of generative AI. So they have a future. But the thing is, is that they feel somewhat gizamped by the big tech firms. They like to feel like they are the backbone of the entrepreneurial system in America and elsewhere. And it's with a bit of Shagra that they feel that they can't afford to play in this game. That said, there are an intrepid few who are still prepared to write really big checks, billion dollar checks, in order to invest in open AI and others. By some estimates, the costs are spiraling exponentially. One estimate suggested that when Chat GPT was released in 2022, the models typically cost $10 million or less to train. It's forward to now. And the equivalent of open AI's GPT 4 model costs anywhere from kind of $50 million to $100 million or more. And what people are doing is extrapolating from that. IE, these models getting 10 times more expensive every generation and saying that pretty soon IE within the next year or two, it may cost a billion dollars or more to train a model. And perhaps eventually $10 billion or more. These are what they call scaling laws. And some people are skeptical about how predictable these scaling laws really are. But this is the basis on which people are prepared to put enormous sums into the models. Because they feel like as they get more expensive, they get better and better and the better that they get, the more chance they have of kind of conquering the world. It's a good question around which there is a huge amount of debate. For a start, there are physical constraints to building bigger and bigger models. It's pretty well known that the models need huge amounts of energy, chips, cooling systems in order to do their magic. And that may slow the process down. But the interesting thing is to see how these constraints are already stimulating bursts of creativity, which after all is what Silicon Valley is supposed to be really good at. So developers are now tweaking the software and the algorithms that support the chips on which these models are trained in order to make them run more efficiently. There are also smaller and more specialized models that are being distilled out of these huge ones. And they're proving to be both cheaper and pretty effective in the last couple of weeks. The new Pnei released its newest model, O1, or better nicknamed as strawberry, which is designed to be better at reasoning, though it's very different from chat GPT. It doesn't generate text. So all of these innovations are making a variety of models, which are each suited to different types of problems. And the cloud service providers on which these models run, they use all of these models in order to make answering a chatbot query cheaper and better. Well, I think it's fair to say that open AI is definitely at an advantage given the fact that it was the first mover and it has Microsoft underpinning it, lots of money, lots of computing power and lots of brain power. You know, it does continue to be the pioneer in the field as we saw with the release of this new model. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it will become the model to rule them all. And I think no one really wants that. This is a dangerous world, generative AI, and you really want a lot more competition rather than a lot less competition. And we're seeing that competition play out. There are other big model makers like Anthropic, Google, Meta and Elon Musk is coming up the rear with XAI and they all have access to a lot of resources and are all trying to catch up. So if the trend continues, I think it's fair to say that the AI universe will be a constellation of models rather than just a single superstar. Thank you Rosie, great to talk to you too."

        "text_corpus": " We've had decades of reductions in the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. They've come down from about 70,000 to about 12,000. Thanks to successive arms control agreements. And we're now seeing a world in which that is reversing. China is building up and the United States for the first time in a very long time has said it is getting ready to increase the size of the stockpile if the president should order that. The new threat is both in terms of quantity and in terms of complexity. First of all, the existing arms control agreements essentially limited the world's two largest nuclear powers, the United States and the Soviet Union and now Russia to be roughly equal with about 1,500 strategic warheads deployed. And those two words are important, strategic and deployed. Strategic means long range, deployed means actually ready to use as opposed to held in stock or in reserve. And the problem is that China has until recently had a very small arsenal of a few hundred warheads and is now building up fast according to the Pentagon to 1,000 warheads by the end of the decade and perhaps 1,500 warheads by 2035. And China and Russia are much closer buddies and they used to be. China is helping Russia, short of providing actual weapons but supplying the defense industrial base for its war in Ukraine. Moreover, other nuclear powers are also more closely bound with Russia and China, North Korea especially but also Iran which is in nuclear threshold state. So altogether the American worry is what happens if all these rivals gang up on us at the same time or what happens if there is a chain reaction of conflicts. So one Pentagon official described to me what he thought was his nightmare scenario. A war in Europe which involves NATO, Russia attacks NATO perhaps the Baltic States, draws in the Americans they get involved in Europe. China takes the opportunity to invade Taiwan thinking the Americans are now stretched and the North Koreans seize the opportunity to reunify South Korea because they see the Americans even more stretched. So could the Americans deal with all those crises and indeed could they deter them beforehand and the Americans are just not clear anymore that they can do so. I hate to frighten people even more but the worrying thing is that the main treaty that limits the weapons of the US and Russia, the new start treaty is about to expire in less than two years time in February 2026 and there is no prospect at the moment of a follow on agreement. Essentially nuclear talks between the two sides have broken down and the Russians and the Americans have more or less stopped abiding by the treaties verification procedures, although they say they still abide by the numerical limits that those treaties impose. In other words, the deployed number of warheads are still the same according to each side but it's more and more difficult to verify that that is taking place because there are no more inspections, they don't report the numbers to each other, they don't report the movements of nuclear weapons and nuclear capable missiles and so on and so forth. So as time goes by there's much greater uncertainty and obviously that creates space for mistakes and miscalculations. On two tracks really, one is to say they continue to be interested in arms control and risk reduction but also to hedge for the future and to get ready for when the new start treaty expires in 2026. If the president decides to do so that they are able to build up quickly the size of the deployed stockpile that means in the first instance taking things out of reserve and putting them on international ballistic missiles or putting them onto submarines or onto bombers and that could potentially give you a very quick increase potentially doubling the deployed stockpile. If you wanted to increase the overall stockpile the total stockpile then that means building many more nuclear weapons which involves more effort and more time not impossible what would take more time. And Americans are currently engaged in a complete modernization of their whole existing nuclear weapons enterprise. So they've got new bombers being built they're building nuclear ballistic missile submarines and they're building new ICBMs. A lot of these programs are over cost and delayed and they're also building a whole new command and control system. That's all allowed within the current arms control systems but they're modernized more capable and so on. So there's a lot of money already going in and the further step is to say how do we reverse the engineering that we did years ago to reduce the numbers that are deployed. In many ways yes it'll be different in that China is much more economically integrated with the United States and the West. It's a different kind of competition than the West had with the Soviet block. But I think on this question nuclear weapons we're in a slow moving arms race that risks accelerating from 2026. There is always the worry that as one side builds up the other side feels it needs to build up in response. There are people that will argue that the United States has more than enough nuclear weapons to deter both China and Russia and others. Does not need to hit every nuclear weapon. Pilo just needs to hold enemy cities at risk and there are people in the arms control. Community who will say look America's thousands of warheads do not buy you that much more deterrent than Britain's or France's couple of hundred warheads. Each I pray and hope it doesn't reach the astronomical numbers that they reach during the Cold War with the ability to destroy the world several times over. And I hope that the lessons that the superpowers learnt in the 60s are remembered and reapplied to the present day. But I'm afraid that for as long as this rivalry with China continues to grow and deepen and Russia's war with Ukraine remains unresolved and continues to go poorly for Russia we are in an age of higher nuclear risks all around. Thank you Rosie."

        "text_corpus": " That's Helen Woods, a professional astrologer. I recently spoke to her to find out more about how astrology works and how it can be used to predict all kinds of things including elections. Helena showed me Donald Trump's horoscope on a shared screen and what I could see was a wheel of zodiac symbols, lines and colors all of which she said was a snapshot of his destiny determined by the positions of planets across different aspects or houses of his life. So that includes things like relationships, his career and by default the upcoming election. To get the most accurate reading, Helena needed Trump's exact time of birth a detail that she finds online. Apparently Kamala Harris has pretty big things happening to her too. Jupiter and Saturn are aligning in her favor. Astronautists have long claimed to be able to chart the fate of politicians, one advised Ronald and Nancy Reagan ahead of meetings with world leaders. But now astrologers are captivating a new generation. In 2022, 37% of Americans aged between 18 to 29 surveyed by Yuga have said they believe in astrology. Helena is one of many astrologers using social media to reach them. Hey there, welcome back to the channel Astro Cartography with Helena, where we talk all about the astrology of place. She has nearly 100,000 subscribers across two YouTube channels. Elections cycles are an opportunity to get viral. Evan Nathaniel Graham accumulated 400,000 TikTok followers and millions of views filming horoscope videos and cosmically informed forecasts about the news. Evan Tommy had a long list of accurate predictions, including that a very volatile event was on the cards for Donald Trump before the assassination attempt happened in July. Evan just knocked C. Trump on a ticket after October, owing in part to what he says is an upcoming Aries fool moon. Any good reputation can be lucrative. Evan told me he has completed thousands of private readings for paying clients. Many astrologers put their juiciest forecasts behind paywalls. And the value of the global astrology market is expected to reach $22.8 billion by 2031, up from $12.8 billion in 2022. But even astrology is not without polarization. Helena told me that she's paused making political videos because they were causing intense division on her channel. Another astrologer told me she's been cancelled over some of her interpretations. And when I spoke to Helena, she also told me that astrologers can predict the future of a country. Turning to America's birth chart, she made some various predictions for the coming years. When I asked her when all of this might calm down, she told me the year 2033. Hang tight, until then."

        "text_corpus": " The Economist seminal books on the subject. People still want faster computers but transistors aren't that much better. We don't get that many in law of them. What do we as computer architects going to do? And the only idea that we've come up with is what we call domain specific architectures. And what that means is we're designing computers for one domain. For the last 20 years, that domain specific architecture that drove that is called a graphics processing unit. And as computer people, we can't say words, so we abbreviate GPU. So graphics processing unit is GPU. So that's the claim to fame for Nvidia. Now, about 12 years ago, people started using a particular form of AI that ran much better on GPUs than they ran on conventional CPUs. So what the GPUs did is what they call parallelism. And they had hundreds of tasks being done at the same time. And because of the great good fortune that the domain specific architecture intended for graphics could also be used for this brand of AI. That started this kind of avalanche of interest in domain specific architecture for AI, specifically GPUs. When you mentioned domain specific architectures Okay, well, even before this historic moment in 2012, Google estimated that neural networks were going to catch on and what would be the consequences to Google if they just use CPUs. And it turned out Google would have to double all of its data centers, double them, which would take a long time and cost a lot of money. So Google started an emergency project to quickly build a domain specific architecture for neural networks. So it wasn't like Nvidia where they took their graphics processor and kind of bent it to add some features for neural network. This is a brand new architecture. So it turns out at the heart of this neural networks, it's a multiplication. In fact, it's matrix multiplication. So that's something that computer architects like me, well, if all you care about or you primarily care about matrix multiply, we can throw a lot of transistors at matrix multiply and make go really fast. So the TPU, which was dedicated just from network, it's had a giant matrix multiply unit. And that was kind of the first commercially successful example of something dedicated for Yeah, so I was involved in writing the papers about the TPUs, but it was kind of remarkable as the factor of 30 better than what was out there. Because this type of artificial intelligence is called machine learning. You give it labeled data and it learns from it and it keeps improving its parameters over time while it's training. So you can think of trainings like sending your kid to college, you know, getting an education. And then after it's trained, after your kid graduates and goes out to get a job, it's called either serving or inference, where you know, go to college, get an education, then do some useful work. So the training can take months on thousands of chips. So what faster means today is you can either give it more data, you know, get it a PhD or you can do the training in less time than other people. And then the serving would mean you could serve 30 times as many people from the same chip, which makes it much more some form of the other designing their own chips. Yeah, well, what's happened now with cloud computing is there these giant companies, you know, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Ali Balvin others that have all of these data centers up until, you know, a decade or so ago, they would just buy from Intel, the main D, the processors that everybody else was doing. But then they recognize, well, it's up to us. And if we wanted to, we could design hardware and deploy it ourselves. So Google got into it because, you know, GPUs in their view weren't perfect and they weren't cheap. They were expensive relatively. And so they thought they could do it themselves and possibly do it better. Once Google did it, then Amazon did the same thing. Microsoft has now, I'm on the same Ali Baba has now said so that all of these software companies have gotten into building their own custom hardware largely inspired by a building domain-specific at architectures for artificial intelligence. thinking on this topic. In computer architecture, there've been times where even if you come up with an idea, Intel wasn't interested because they were making tons of money and they knew what they weren't doing and get lost, kid. This is not one of those times. Nobody is confident that they have the only great way to go. So it's a very exciting time to be a researcher in computer architecture. People are desperate for new ideas. We're trying to figure out how to get faster computers without the help of Mars Law. So nobody's saying, get lost, kid. They're every single, please work on our"

        "text_corpus": " Somewhere near here, we've been given a drop pin to meet Ivan Barryak. We're going to be deputy commander of the 93rd brigade. We're going up the hill onto the skyline. This part of Ukraine is flat, nearly as far as the Icon Sea, which on a clear day in mid-September is quite far. The sky stretches across a basin full of mining towns where the main geographic features are not hills or mountains, but landscaped piles of rock and earth dug from the ground – minerals extracted and then smoothed into flat-toped mountains called slagheeds. The names of these small towns and villages might not be familiar to you yet, but they may soon become as infamous as Bachmut, directly to the east of me. That city was almost entirely raised last year by the Russian campaign to get control of it, which they do now. It's a blackened and destroyed prize. To the south of me is Pukrofsk, which many worry will likely suffer the same fate. You can't see the Russian positions with the naked eye. Better through the scope of a rifle, jokes our guide, Ivan. But they're close. And can they drone see us? Overhead, always, are the drones. Vlad has been keeping an audio diary for us during a crucial period at a crucial part of the front line. Russian and Ukrainian forces are battling for control of Pokrovsk. That town just south of here. It's a big strategic prize, a mining town, and an important transport hub. And with the landscape so flat, there are not many natural defenses between Pokrovsk and the next town, or indeed the administrative boundaries of Donetsk region. The region Putin says he wants to liberate. Lose Pokrovsk and Russian forces could roll across this plane. That's not Ukraine's only challenge right now. Winter is coming. Some western partners are tiring. And the US election is only six weeks away. It's crunch time for Ukraine. And I've traveled from the east of the country to Washington, DC to work out what lies ahead. Walking along the darkened corridor from the commander's office. First, I wanted to get a sense of how the war is being fought. And increasingly, that's a cat and mouse game between man and drones. Down towards the cellars, I guess. In the basement of a non-descript Soviet era building, I can't tell you exactly where. There are workstations with gaming chairs and banks of screens. Each one showing the video feed from a different drone. Hands is in charge of one of them. Anything moves and he goes after it. He shows us the results of his handiwork. When a group of Russian armored vehicles tried to move in on a Ukrainian position. When I look up, I see that the video feed on one of the live screens has swooped and zoomed in on a tall structure in a brown field. They're on the lookout for both Russian soldiers and Russian equipment. It's too windy right now, but they'll be back for that antenna later. And they'll monitor Russian communications to find out exactly what it was. It's an impressive operation. All overseen by a young man who goes by the call sign Achilles. Can I ask you how old you are? 93 years old and how long have you been commander for? The bitch since the start of the war. And yours is one of the most effective drone battalions. Top three. Top three. Achilles or Yuri is 33 with short dark hair, darker eyebrows and a single earring. The golden hoop with an engraved bell bottom is a replica of an old Cosax style, an independent Ukrainian warrior class from centuries past. Yuri joined the National Guard at 18 and fought in Eastern Ukraine when Russia first invaded in 2014. After he was severely injured, he started a business in Kiev and joined the city council. But since the first day of the full scale invasion, he's been fighting again alongside his friends. This time as one of Ukraine's drone hot shots. And what kind of drones do you specialize in? At this point, Yuri switches to Ukrainian. And so my colleague, our correspondent, Oli Carroll, is translating. When you look at your drone capability and the Russians drone capability, are they ahead? The picture that emerges is complicated. Russia might still be ahead when it comes to those traditional winged reconnaissance drones. But Ukraine is innovating fast. They're better at creating and using small attack drones, and even using AI for targeting. The problem for Ukraine, as Yuri's boss Vadim Sukharewski tells me, is scale. Vadim Sukharewski is Ukraine's commander of unmanned systems forces. Vadim's role is new. The first of its kind in the world, he thinks it's just as game-changing as the creation of air forces at the beginning of the last century. It's his job to bring the kind of drone technology that Achilles and other tech savvy brigades are using to the whole of Ukraine's armed forces. He's working on new airborne reconnaissance drones, sea drones, and land-based drones too. It takes an average of seven small drones to destroy a tank. But near Pukrozk, where the Russians are throwing not just men, but all their military might, they're protecting equipment with even more electronic jamming. Multiply that across the entire front, and the numbers are staggering. For Susharevsky, the focus is less on Western weapons than Western money. He tells me Ukraine can produce better drones, more cheaply, than anything their partners could send. 250 drone producers are making more than the military can afford to buy off them. Individual brigade commanders are crowdfunding to purchase drones directly from a network of manufacturers, by passing headquarters entirely. The official position is that Ukraine will fight for Pukrozk, but if the supply of Western weapons speeds up, it soldiers can hold the line. Not only that, but with enough support they can retake the territory they lost, not just in this war, but back to 2014, when Russia first pushed into the Donbass and seized Crimea. But what I learned in my travels across Ukraine, and the various conversations I had both on the record and off, is that Whispererit, Pukrozk is in trouble. One senior official told me he considers it already lost. And again, Whispererit, but Ukraine won't have the capacity any time soon to push the Russians out, take back its land, and return to the country's 1991 borders. No one will admit it publicly, but the real point now is to stop the Russian advance for long enough to build realistic defenses, both physical and political, to permanently protect what Ukraine currently has. It's not actually the flat agricultural lands that we're driving through right now that make this really important. It's the mining, it's the steel making, and to be pro. We're heading for one of those mining towns, Pavlovrad, a town of 100,000 people. If Pukrovsk falls, which is clearly a possibility, and the Russians take the rest of the towns and villages on the plains of the Donbas, then Pavlovrad will be the last sizable Ukrainian town before the Russians. Before heading in, we pull over to get fuel. The air strikes, the buses full of wounded and dead soldiers, military vehicles on the roads and at the petrol stations and soldiers in uniform on the streets. Pavlokhrad feels like a town in a country at war. Something that the larger cities like Kiev and Odessa don't feel like at all. Recent polling suggests that Ukrainians attitudes towards the war are changing. A bit and a half of the population is now open to the idea of a negotiated end to the fighting. The question is on what terms? The vast majority are still opposed to giving up any territory, even Crimea or the parts of the Donbass that Russia has now occupied for a decade. But the number considering it has shot up since last autumn after the failure of Ukraine's counteroffensive. 32% of Ukrainians would now consider some territorial concessions in exchange for peace. And the trend is more pronounced in those parts of the country closer to the fighting. And so I was curious about Pavlokhrad. Tatiana is selling flowers in the street. Professional looking bouquets that she's arranged out of cuttings from her own garden. She's cycled here, towing the flowers behind her bike on a red wagon. And in front of the wagon is a handwritten sign. She's not just selling flowers, but an apartment. The Russian ones, she means. And there's a glint in her eye. There's a history to Ukrainian grandmothers poisoning Russian soldiers with pies. Tatiana thinks the Ukrainian soldiers will keep fighting down to the last man. But when we catch up back at the core, my colleagues Anastasia Parfenyuk and Akharyostrovsky tell me they spoke to others who were less resolute. And a mother whose two sons worked in the coal mine here before the full scale invasion. That's when they signed up to fight. Her younger son died at the front nine days ago. We pause for lunch at a cafe in central Pavlochrad. Sitting at a table outside are two young men. Soldiers, but not in uniform, smoking and waiting for their meal. They nod as we walked in with our kid and then later asked if we're journalists. They clearly have something to say. They tell us they are infantry soldiers, deployed at what's called the contact line, the closest to Russian soldiers. We've heard a lot about the meat grinder. Those Russian soldiers are thrown into, with little regard from their superiors for their lives. But these two Ukrainian infantrymen say they feel their commanders don't care about them either. On their last mission, Nierpokrovsk, they tell me their commander ordered them to stay in position and protect a piece of expensive equipment. Even though they didn't have enough weapons to protect themselves. Three forms if it is equipment. And what weaponry do you have? How many people run away? A lot. And is it more people now running away? Yes, of course. What are two young soldiers can't bring themselves to say, until much later, is that they themselves are some of the runaways. They told us nearly half the men they fought with had done the same. Across the whole of the armed forces, one senior official told us, the average number is about 10%. That means a total of 100,000 have deserted or gone AWOL. From my conversations with soldiers, commanders and generals, it's becoming clear to me that the Ukrainian army is not uniform. There are elements of the old Soviet army, what these two young runaways told me, sounded depressingly similar to the Russian meat grinder. But some individual brigades are well equipped and well-funded, by businessmen and wealthy individuals, or crowdsourced donations that allow them to buy drones, weapons and body armor directly from Ukraine's growing domestic military industry. Some of these units have waiting lists of 500 men wishing to transfer into them from other parts of the army. They operate with the degree of autonomy, and have developed a good reputation, like Achilles who runs the drone unit. His golden earring, consciously or not, harks back to a very Ukrainian phenomenon, the independent Kossaks, a militarized democracy of semi-autonomous brigades, negotiating where and how they fight, an asset now when the country needs motivated men, but an issue if things begin to splinter. It's easy to see what difference a good senior officer can make to the morale of his men. It could mean the difference between life and death. Flad, our commander on the front, sending us voice memos from the dugout, pride himself on being one of the good ones, checking in on his men, and pulling them back when it's proven to do so. Some Russian soldiers had somehow snuck through the lines and got very close to his mortar positions. Flad and his commander decided the team should be pulled out. That was not an isolated incident. Ukrainian officials say it's increasingly common. Russia is pressing cooks and drivers to the front line, and it's so much more refuse to fight, are locked in basements, and beaten into compliance. The Russians are now paying four times as much as at the beginning of the war to entice men into the army. In August, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia itself, claiming more than 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory, which President Zelensky said he would hold on to indefinitely. Many Russian resources from the Eastern Front as the Ukrainian top brass might have hoped, it was a major bump in morale, and it demonstrated very clearly that the Russian army is also stretched, and struggles to fight on two fronts at once. And while the Russian population, and resources, are undoubtedly larger, there are signs that they're also running short of men and armor. Both countries are stretched to the limit, so it becomes a kind of race to the bottom. Who tires first? The strain on civilian life is undoubtedly higher in Ukraine. 18% of territory occupied, it cities regularly under attack from drones, missiles, and glide bombs. And in Kiev, where bells ring every day for those fallen and captured by Russia, some Ukrainian officials will acknowledge privately that they're expecting this winter to be the most difficult of all. As Russia redoubles its efforts to knock out the electricity grid, causing residents to shiver and freeze in the dark. In the capital, I spoke to the man responsible for keeping the lights on, Bitalia Klicchko, the former boxer, and mayor of Kiev. And do you think the people in the street, the people in the cafes, the people in the bars that are full right now, they know what lies ahead in the coming months? Is the government are you doing enough to tell them what is coming? To find out whether that was true, I went to the real seat of power in Ukraine, the presidential compound. When I'm driving through the central district of Kiev, going to the presidential offices to meet with Andrej Yamark, President Zelensky's chief of staff and right-hand man. In an office that's increasingly centralizing control behind these checkpoints in the capital, I sat down with the man who matters. We don't trust rush. He pointed to previous agreements which have been broken Ukraine is looking at elections next year. In the wings, political challengers to President Zelensky are watching too. In our case, quite literally. When we speak to the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, in his office, sitting quietly beside him is his younger brother Vladimir. His name is being banded about as a potential challenger. And while Vladimir is not a politician yet, he's learning. What happens then to your ability to be resilient, your ability to continue? But like almost all Ukrainians, he believes Russia will only use any ceasefire or negotiated end to the war to regroup and attack again. And so what does that look like? I'm sitting with Major General Valodymey Khobachuk, Deputy Chief of the General Staff. He's a senior commanding officer, with direct influence over the Army's strategic decisions. What do you need for Ukraine to be able to defend its borders? Do you need to be a member of NATO? As a military man, what will you need to have to be able to defend your country even after this war is finished? But can Ukraine ever be strong enough on its own? Imagine a Russia, rearmed and reinvigorated, decides to breach whatever peace deal is agreed. That risk is real, it's happened before. So the big question is what will deter Russia from doing it again? And do you, even if you are not a NATO member country, does your military force need to be interoperable with NATO member countries? Ukraine has one of the only armies to have fought a major land war in recent decades. And it's definitely the only one which has fought Russia. As a result, they are at the cutting edge of modern warfare, whether it's in terms of drone technology, communications, or even battlefield medicine. Interferably operating theatre, I can see the operating table. I'm in an operating room at an underground medical stabilization point, not far from the front lines. A concentrator under the back there, what is that thing? That's the realisation machine right on the back left. Roman Kuzif is the chief medic here. He designed the whole thing and then his colleagues spent three months digging it out, stabilising it with wood, and then putting it out with a lot of high grade medical technology. Part of the reason it's made out of wood is that if, or Roman thinks when, the Russians find out this location and launch a strike, any shrapnel damage from wood will be less than concrete. He tells me that evacuating wounded soldiers from the front line is incredibly difficult. Russia doesn't just ignore the Geneva conventions about hitting medical personnel. He says they no longer put red crosses or anything that might identify medics on their vehicles because they are actively targeted. And so wounded soldiers have to lie where they fall until it gets dark, and a secret rescuation can be mounted. It means that the NATO standard of the golden hour, getting soldiers to a facility within the first hour of injury, is a total fiction when it comes to how this war is actually being fought. And so the Ukrainians have stepped up what they're able to do. From the moment they collect their soldiers, instead of transporting them to hospitals far from the front lines, they treat them here. And so the question turns to America. In January 2025, will it have a president who continues to support Ukraine, who presses for its accession to NATO, or one who abandons it? At a conference in Kiev in September, I put that question to President Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He pushes back hard on the idea that another Trump presidency would be a disaster for Ukraine. He thinks the real damage has been done by a frightened and indecisive Biden administration. The difficulty is that if President Trump wins the election in November, it's not clear what kind of Trump foreign policy the world will get. Will it be a Pompeo Trump, or a version more in line with his running mate JD Vance, who opposed the most recent assistance package, and has said that he, quote, doesn't really care about Ukraine. Senator Chris Murphy is a prominent member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a man who might end up with a big job if it's Kamala Harris who wins the upcoming election. With the election on a knife edge, and American support unclear, could Europe step up to help Ukraine win the war? General Freuding is one of Germany's top soldiers. And he thinks this represents an opportunity for Europe. Do you think the Ukrainians now have capabilities He told me it's clear to him that Ukraine must join NATO and the fact that Ukraine doesn't control all of its territory is not the obstacle that some believe. After all, West Germany joined NATO long before its reunification. Not everyone is in lockstep with this NATO idea. Senator Chris Murphy thinks it could be a distraction. I've been listening to your voice. I'm Zany, Vincent Bettos. In Kramatursk, I finally meet Vlad. Our commander on the front sending us voice memos from the dugout. We head to a quiet cafe. He tells me he was a photographer before the war. He mostly did weddings. But he very much looks the part of a soldier now and his uniform is immaculate. He joined up in the first days after the full-scale invasion where he was sent to Bucher and Eurpin. He's seen a lot and lost friends. I asked him, if his leader's negotiator deal that means Russia gets to keep some of the territory deceased, can that ever feel like victory? That's the crux of the problem President Zelensky finds himself in right now. Having spent more than two years defining victory in absolutist terms, pushing the Russians out of all the territory they've occupied since 2014. It's hard now for him, or for any other Ukrainian politician, to settle for anything less. But at the same time, it's clear that Ukraine will not be able to push the Russians out completely and regain all its land by force. The real question is whether Ukraine can hold onto the territory it still controls and whether the West will give it a credible security guarantee. But no one is willing to admit this publicly in Kiev. A political cowardice enabled by Ukraine's Western partners because they hide behind the mantra that Ukraine must win and that Ukrainians alone will determine what victory looks like. This is a recipe for disaster. The war cannot continue at today's intensity indefinitely. The risk is that Ukraine's defenses will buckle and its society fracture. Far from becoming the prosperous Westwood-oriented democracy it aspires to be, Ukraine could lose and descend into chaos, an angry, embittered population, aggrieved at what it sees as Western perfidy and with heavily armed partisan militias. That would be a catastrophe for Ukraine and for the West. To avoid that outcome, Ukraine and its Western backers will need to be both bold and realistic. Mr Zalensky will have to convince his fellow Ukrainians that the focus for now has to be for Ukraine to become a prosperous country that can defend the territory it has. And Ukraine's Western partners need to give it the wherewithal to do so. That will demand more weapons, more money to build up Ukraine's own defense industry and in my view, at least, the most credible of all guarantees and invitation to join NATO. A well-defended, prosperous Ukraine that is firmly part of the West, that is the right definition of victory. And it is one that I suspect most Ukrainians would settle for. The door slams shut on our armoured vehicle. I'm now sitting on a bench seat in the back, as it hurtles along a very bumpy dirt road, heading into Gaza. I'm bouncing along in my flat jacket and helmet, squashed next to several Israeli soldiers, kitted out with full body armour and weapons. We're driving along a new road inside Gaza, highway 749, or what the Israeli's called, the Netsareem corridor. It's a strip of land cleared and controlled by the Israeli military that cuts Gaza in two. Its stretches from the border, runs just south of Gaza City, and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. It used to be a sort of agricultural and industrial area, farms, warehouses, a few homes. Our Middle East correspondent Greg Kallstrom has been in Gaza many times before, but found it difficult to recognise anything. Analysis of satellite imagery suggests around 60% of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. Schools, hospitals, the sanitation system, mostly in ruins. Just clearing the rubble will take years, let alone the process of rebuilding. But that's the long view. I've come here to find out what happens on the real day after. What happens in the days, weeks and months, right after the fighting stops? If it stops. After nine months of war, the only way for international journalists to get into Gaza is still to do what's called an embed with the Israeli military. That means soldiers escort you, determining where you go and what you see. Unusually, rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, head spokesman for the IDF, has decided to accompany us himself. Just now. Well, luckily I didn't even notice that two rockets had fallen 150 meters from us. And where are they fired from? That moment really drove home to me, that even after nine months of a sustained aerial bombing campaign and ground invasion, the IDF still doesn't have full control of the Gaza Strip. As the death toll climbs towards 40,000 according to the health ministry in Gaza, and amid increasing international pressure on Israel and another round of ceasefire negotiations, my question is who will run Gaza when the dust settles and with what legitimacy? Dana Stroul is director of research for the Washington Institute of Near East Policy. The Americans have a bit of experience in post-conflict reconstruction. Though Dana freely admits that in Iraq and Afghanistan, that experience is perhaps in knowing what mistakes not to make. But she says, the key thing they've learned is about what's called the golden hour, the immediate period after the fighting stops, when the most important thing is to have a plan. And they have been trying to push their ally Israel into making one. Dana told me there are essentially five options for who provide security in Gaza, when or if there is a ceasefire. The first is that Israel maintains a law enforcement and security presence inside Gaza, an occupation in effect. That's obviously unacceptable to Palestinians and indeed most governments around the world, and something that Israeli leaders themselves have said they don't want. What many do want is some kind of international force. Many of the Israeli politicians you'll hear from are convinced that there is a pan-Arab coalition ready and willing to run Gaza. But start probing, and there seems little appetite from Arab governments to actually take on what would be a physically and politically dangerous role. Then there are the two options, most people on all sides agreed would be a bad idea. Getting private contractors to handle security, or the return of Hamas as a formal governing power in Gaza. Which leaves an option, the Americans, and most everyone else, except for the Israeli political establishment favors. That's the return of control to the security forces of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority is run by Mahmoud Abbas and his fatter political faction. They haven't been in power in Gaza for 17 years. Even its grip on the West Bank is tenuous. The Israeli military conducts raids at will, undermining its authority. What little authority it has, having not held elections since 2006. But nonetheless, that option of some reformed Palestinian Authority is one that the United States is pushing. The President of the PA, Mahmoud Abbas, very rarely gives interviews. But we have come to the Prime Minister's office to meet the man newly installed in that role, Muhammad Mustafa, an economist in his late 60s, one of the President's longtime advisors, who was appointed Prime Minister in March. We were led upstairs to a large formal meeting room. The Prime Minister was initially wary about recording an interview. So we took our notebooks out. He began telling me about the financial problems facing the PA, which is being strangled by Israel's refusal to dispense its share of tax revenue. Reserves are running out. Government employees are only receiving part of their salary. He described the relationship with the Israelis as dysfunctional. They're not talking. He and his colleagues only found out that the money was being shut off when it didn't arrive. We spoke for over an hour, and at the end of our conversation, I asked if he'd go on tape. He conferred with an aid and left the room for a few moments, before returning with a piece of paper in hand. And this is a completely destroyed pile of rubble. Shahabil Al-Zayim is a tall man in his seventies, elegantly dressed and extremely punctual. He arrives at our Saturday evening meeting in Ramallah in a navy suit, a tiny Palestinian flag pinned to his lapel. Shahabil is a lawyer from Gaza City, and he told me that before the war, his firm handled about 60% of all commercial legal business in Gaza. His villa had not just a pool, but its own source of electricity. Another client paid for the new surgery department at Chief of Hospital, the main medical facility in Gaza, which has now been destroyed by the IDF. Shahabil is basically a fixer, a mover and a shaker. He talks to everyone and maintains relations because that's what he needs to do. He tells me proudly he answers every phone call from anyone. And his two phones, stacked neatly one on top of the other, sit within reach on the table the whole time we talk. But Shahabil's stature and connections in Gaza were also a threat to Hamas. Who, after winning elections in 2006, engaged in a campaign of intimidating, not just their rivals in Fata, but anybody who might threaten their authority? It wasn't a one-off. One day, when Shahabil was working, somebody sprayed his car with bullets. On the morning of October 7th, he was up early as usual, having a coffee outside. On TV, he saw the images of Hamas fighters inside Israel, and he knew immediately that the retaliation would be brutal. His wife wanted to leave Gaza right away. A week later, Shahabil, like so many others, fled Gaza City. Multiple evacuation orders meant he moved several times, until, thanks to his connections, he was one of the lucky ones on a list of people allowed to leave Gaza. He crossed into Egypt on the 31st of December. Three months later, he accepted a position as the Justice Minister in the new administration of the Palestinian Authority. He'd been asked to play roles in the PA before, but always refused. But everything is different now, and he told me he felt it was time to serve. He was sworn in by video link, because Israel still hadn't granted him permission to enter the West Bank from Jordan. Since then, he's been actively planning for what happens when the war ends, when the dust settles. And he says nothing can be done without agreement between Fata and Hamas, so that Palestinian civil police can take over security. And he's insistent that the civil police who have lived and worked inside Gaza under Hamas can be trusted to do the job. Are you talking to Hamas now? It's clear that the Palestinian Authority wants to play a role and that its leaders feel they are ready. But what is less clear is whether they are indeed capable of governing a shattered Gaza. They have already been some efforts to reestablish a Palestinian Authority security presence inside Gaza. And it has not gone well. In March, PA guards were used to secure an aid delivery. Those guards were captured and reportedly tortured by Hamas. Three were killed. Episodes like that don't exactly inspire confidence that Hamas really is ready to step back. Almost everyone I speak to hopes that they will, that the group will not demand a central role in Gaza's future, even though there is a growing consensus that it won't be fully defeated. Hamas told me as much when I spoke to one of its senior officials, Musa Abu Maazuk, in Qatar, three days after the October 7th attacks. And Basem Naim, a member of Hamas's political bureau, is still saying it now. Our Middle East correspondent, Nick Pellam, met with him recently in Istanbul. Naim said that sure, Hamas has had phases of plateau or decline in its 50 year history. But he was convinced they would endure. The problem is, while most rule out any role for Hamas, the Israelis won't countenance having the fatarun PA in charge either. One official close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the PA as a problem, confirmed that the Israeli government wasn't talking to them, but instead unspecified local Palestinian elements in Gaza. The Israeli government has been attempting to make contact with a handful of powerful families, big clans which used to wield huge clout in Gaza and are still influential. The idea seems to be to sidestep the PA and Hamas, or any organized political body that might conceivably form a future Palestinian state, and use these families as a kind of Azat's government power. Shahabiyal is doubtful. And that's if there was a unified Israeli wish at all. The real problem is not only that some Israeli officials are pinning their hopes on improbable ideas. It's that there is no consensus within Israel, let alone a clear government plan on what the day after in Gaza should look like. One official assured me that there is a detailed government plan, but couldn't say what it is because if word got out that the plan came from Israel it would be dead on arrival. Let's assume that's true. There's still a question as to whether Netanyahu and his advisors will even be in power to implement this shroding as plan. Three quarters of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign, either immediately or once the war ends. He has no plans to do so, but pressure is growing in Israel's parliament and on the streets. There are also smaller quieter roadside vigils and encampments. Walking between government offices in Jerusalem, I find layer holding a sign blaming Netanyahu for the failures on October 7th. But just up the road, another group of protesters want the war to continue. 22-year-old Yael is holding a poster of her brother, a soldier. It feels like it's just after October 7th. And there's virtually no mention of gars and civilians. The war feels miles away. But yet it's a country traumatized, and a country on edge, and a country whose politics seems completely dysfunctional. In fact, it's outside the government that you can find people with more detailed plans for what should come next in Gaza. I talked to prominent politicians from across the political spectrum, from Dovish left to extreme right. They were all hoping to see off Netanyahu, and they all had quite different ideas for what to do next. Sitting outside a cafe overlooking Jerusalem, we meet Yoaz Hendel. He's a left-hand up colonel in the IDF, who has spent most of the last nine months in Gaza. He's straight out of central casting. Tall, tan, a pair of sporty, iridescent sunglasses on his head. He's also an ex-minister. He served under Netanyahu in the past. But Yoaz has been organizing a new center-right party of reservists, planning to run against Netanyahu in the next election. Yoaz isn't fussed to run civilian affairs in Gaza, so long as the Israeli military can still conduct operations. But do you think in the long term won't you need to offer the Palestinians the prospect of a better life? If you want this to be a key to a kind of medium term, better future, don't you have to somehow change the mindset that they don't see you like that? He is adamant, the war is not about conquering territory. But in the same breath, says Israel would need to control buffer zones inside Gaza. Yohaz is working his way back towards the Knesset. He and the other reservists in his party are running on a platform of security for Israelis in the Kibbutzim, New Gaza. If that means a permanent presence on the high ground inside Gaza, then so be it. And while he dismisses the idea of resettlement, of Israeli civilians returning to Gaza as fringe, the problem is there are parties with these supposedly fringe views, not just in Israel's parliament, but also at the heart of Netanyahu's coalition. Simkhaw Rothman is a member of the religious Zionist party, part of the government. He is one of the chief architects of the judicial reform law that sparked mass protests against Netanyahu's government last year. I went to see him in his office in the Knesset. On the wall, he has a map that at first glance looks familiar. It shows the West Bank with areas highlighted in different colors. It looks like the maps that have been shared widely in recent years, charting the growth of illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. Except there's one big difference. Rothman and his colleagues on the far right in Israeli politics operate in a world where Palestinians are the ones taking over the West Bank. A world where actually you don't say Palestinians or indeed West Bank. In this world, you also don't talk about the day after. What does that mean in practice? Does it mean that Israel has to occupy Gaza, has to oversee this program of denazification as you put it? So the center right, a keen on continued Israeli capability for raids into Gaza. And somebody, we don't mind who, but somebody, to take over municipal affairs. If far right, don't want to talk about the day after a tool. What about the Israeli left or what used to be called its center? We've left Simfaz Office and Anshel is winding us through the Knesset to meet another politician. My conversation with Yehugaland starts with the same question I've asked everyone so far. Namely, is there a plan? And if so, what is it? The way Israeli politicians talk, you might think that Arab countries, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE or Saudi Arabia are lining up to assist them to rebuild and run Gaza. Some of those countries have said they're happy to contribute with money and aid. The UAE even says it might join a stabilization force, but under conditions that are unlikely to be met. And in private, our conversations with Arab officials do not suggest a deep well of enthusiasm for the task of actually being in charge of security or law and order. And Dana Stool, the ex pentagon advisor, isn't even sure that they are up to it. It's not clear why so many in Israel are certain it will happen, especially since the first condition that Arab states would require, an Israeli commitment to a Palestinian state, seems further away than ever. It might take a bit more than that. And what does Yair imagine this Arab assistance would actually do inside Gaza? I left the Knesset thinking that what was once fringe is now in the heart of government, and that the traditional moderate Israeli left has been marginalized, literally pushed to the back blocks of the Parliament building. But interestingly, that man from the marginalized center left has a plan not all that different from the ideas of a powerful figure on Israel's central right. He told me that what is needed is an intensification of the military operations, a surge, but focused on one part of Gaza to create something pretty similar to Yeh'e-Goland's islands of hope. In Bennett's mind, once civilians have departed and competence been killed, these areas would be ready to be repopulated and start again. Bennett was not the only Israeli I met who wants dramatic changes to society in Gaza. Another official told me that yes, it's a shame so many mosques were destroyed, but described it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where reconstruction could be linked to de-radicalization. That official suggested the UAE could fund mosques and then do what they do at home, ensure that every imam delivers the same sanitized Friday sermon. Would your partner for civil governance in Gaza be the Palestinian Authority? That's what the Americans are very keen to happen, that the PA is the partner. Do you think it can be the partner? So they would be reasonable for Palestinian players but not the PA? That's right. The problem, of course, is that Israel's campaign in Gaza is destroying the water pipes and killing the water engineers. On the 21st of June, just a few days before we had this conversation at Naftali Bennett's house, an Israeli strike killed five water engineers while they were on duty in Gaza City, including the director general in charge of all water and environmental affairs. His name was Anwar Aljundi Abu Subi. And that is the horrible tragedy of this conflict. The death and destruction in Gaza grind on, while in air conditioned rooms, Israeli politicians talk about Gaza 2.0 or islands of hope. Tarneme is in Der Albala. She's local staff for an international NGO. On our brief visit to Gaza with the Israeli military, there was no question of meeting or talking to Palestinian civilians. She sent us this voice note. Tarneme herself has lost 14 cousins. Most recently she said, one was killed by a quadcopter when they went out to get bread. Like almost everyone in Gaza, Tarneme's own house has been destroyed and she has moved several times. First from her home in central Gaza, then to Raffa, now back to Der Albala. Matthew Hollingworth works for the World Food Programme. We met in Jerusalem after he just completed another stint in Gaza, often personally accompanying 8 convoys to guarantee that drivers are safe and food gets where it needs to go. Along with everything else, the banking system has collapsed. There are now only two or three working ATMs in the Gaza Strip. Armed criminal gangs provide the only modicum of security in the long queues. For a fee, they take a cut of which each person withdraws. Muhammad lives in Gaza. He's local staff from Medical NGO currently based in D.A. Albala. He sent us this voice note. But they aren't always able to. And eight convoys have been attacked and looted. Palestinian businessmen say that this doesn't happen to their own trucks and drivers because they are part of the social fabric of Gaza. This is Ali Shaf, an engineer from Raffa. In October last year he was in the middle of a project to bring more investment from the West Bank to Gaza and had been granted a rare permit to leave for meetings. He stuck outside Gaza now, watching on helplessly as family members die. We spoke in Ramallah in the large basement conference room of a big hotel in the city. A city which has sort of ground to a halt. Workers from the West Bank haven't been allowed into Israel since October 7th. Few people are making much money. The restaurants are quiet and so is the hotel. Investment plans feel far away. Ali has been agitating for a greater role for people like him in getting supplies into Gaza. And Ali is scathing of the assertion that the Israeli army must be allowed to continue incursions into Gaza. Or to hold onto the areas they have cleared and controlled, like the Netsarim corridor and another swath of territory on the border with Egypt called the Philadelphia corridor. He sees it as a way for Netsar Niyahu to permanently divide Gaza. But nothing he has heard has made him optimistic about Gaza's immediate prospects. There is a scenario where they do stop the war in the sense that they stop large scale operations. They withdraw to the border but they continue to go in when they feel they need to take out a senior Hamas person. There are occasional but much less than now. No, I'm not just making a judgment of whether this is right. I'm just laying out a scenario that I actually think is quite probable. The Israelis say that for their own security they need to have the capability to do that. In that scenario what happens? When you're in Israel today, it's easy to understand the focus on what it needs for security. The country is understandably traumatized. But sitting with Ali, sitting with his anger, underscored that none of the Israeli leaders I spoke to seemed to understand the present anguish or longstanding grievance of Palestinians. And that's one of the many reasons I've ended up more pessimistic. It's not just that there are extremists on both sides whose visions of the future are wholly incompatible. It's not just that the scale of the task is monumental, the rebuilding of a shattered country and society. It's that there is no agreement, let alone serious planning among the more moderate voices on both sides, on the practicalities of how to provide both security for Israelis and competent legitimate governance in Gaza. There's too much magical realism, the hope that something some group of outsiders will come to the rescue. And that seems vanishingly unlikely to happen. America is the one country with serious experience in day after plans. But its willingness to get involved is strictly limited and so far hasn't been very effective. In March, the US announced it was building a floating pier off the coast to help deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. Palestinians and aid workers questioned why the Americans would spend their money on a complicated engineering solution when they could have instead pressured Israel to open more land crossings. The pier, which cost more than $200 million, spent most of its short life under repair. And even when it was working, as I saw myself, the aid that was offloaded from boats couldn't be safely distributed. Many people inside Gaza believe there was an ulterior motive for its construction. They suspect that what America really wanted was to help Israel's military rather than supply aid to Palestinians. Three weeks after our visit, the Americans officially decided to decommission the pier. The failure of this ill-fated pier seems to me to be a powerful, depressing metaphor for Gaza's future. The door slams shut on our armored vehicle. I'm now sitting on a bench seat in the back, as it hurtles along a very bumpy dirt road, heading into Gaza. I'm bouncing along in my flat jacket and helmet, squashed next to several Israeli soldiers, kitted out with full body armour and weapons. We're driving along a new road inside Gaza, highway 749, or what the Israelis call the Net Serim corridor. It's a strip of land cleared and controlled by the Israeli military that cuts Gaza in two. Its stretches from the border, runs just south of Gaza City, and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. It used to be a sort of agricultural and industrial area, farms, warehouses, a few homes. Our Middle East correspondent Greg Kallstrom has been in Gaza many times before, but found it difficult to recognize anything."
